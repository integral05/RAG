Robinson1, Ilana Seff1,2 ,\\nAlli Gillespie1 , Jonathan Colarelli1, and Debbie Landis3\\nAbstract\\nOne in three women and girls will experience violence in their lifetime. In conflict and postconflict settings, the incidence of\\nviolence against women and girls (VAWG) is exacerbated, resulting in increased negative social, economic, health, and psy-\\nchosocial effects. In an attempt to prevent and respond to the occurrence of VAWG in humanitarian settings, Women and Girls\\nSafe Spaces (WGSS) have been promoted as a promising intervention. The authors conducted a systematic review to examine the\\ncurrent quantitative evidence available on the impact and effectiveness of WGSS programs. The authors reviewed relevant peer-\\nreviewed and gray literature using predefined search terms for potential inclusion. Seven records met inclusion criteria. Records\\nincluded evaluations of WGSS programs implemented in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania,\\nKenya, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. While none of the studies reported reductions in exposure to or incidence of VAWG among\\nprogram participants, three evaluations demonstrated moderate improvements in psychosocial well-being, social support, and\\nattitudes toward rites of passage. Additionally, only three of the seven evaluations employed rigorous methodologies. This study\\nillustrates the paucity of existing quantitative evidence around the impact of WGSS and the need for further research examining\\nthe potential benefits of this widely implemented intervention for women and girls. A stronger evidence base has the potential to\\ninform policy and program development and to help governments, organizations, and communities better allocate limited\\nresources in response to VAWG.\\nKeywords\\nsafe spaces, evaluation, conflict, gender-based violence, systematic review\\nIn 1993, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly issued the\\nDeclaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women,\\nformally affirming that violence against women and girls\\n(VAWG) is a human rights violation and charging UN states\\nwith eliminating physical, sexual, and psychological violence\\ntargeted against women and girls (IASC, 2006; UN General\\nAssembly, 1994). In humanitarian settings, which are typically\\ncharacterized by destabilization of local infrastructure, break-\\ndown of social supports, and impunity for perpetrators, the risk\\nof VAWG is often elevated (Aas, 2010; Farr, 2009; IASC,\\n2006; Marsh et al., 2006; Robles, 2014; Stark et al., 2017;\\nUnited Nations Population Fund [UNFPA], 2019; United\\nNations, 2015). In these settings, women and girls may face\\nhigher levels of disruption to education, forced or early mar-\\nriage, exploitation, and physical and sexual violence (Stark\\net al., 2020). Sexual violence can be deployed as a conflict\\ntactic in order to displace communities, seize land and\\nresources, recruit young males, and establish repression, terror,\\nand control (El-Mouelhy, 2004; Farr, 2009; Marsh et al., 2006;\\nStark & Wessells, 2012; UN Secretary-General, 2019). Addi-\\ntionally, despite the elevated risk in humanitarian settings\\nof violence perpetrated by combatants, intimate partner vio-\\nlence (IPV) remains the most prevalent form of violence expe-\\nrienced by women and girls (Stark & Ager, 2011; Stark et al.,\\n2010, 2017).\\nIn an attempt to prevent and respond to violence experi-\\nenced by women and girls in humanitarian settings, interna-\\ntional aid organizations have promoted Women and Girls Safe\\n1 Brown School, Washington University in St. Louis, MO, USA\\n2 Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA\\n3 CARE USA, Washington, DC, USA\\nCorresponding Author:\\nLindsay Stark, Brown School, Washington University in St. Louis, Campus Box\\n1196, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.\\nEmail: lindsaystark@wustl.edu\\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\\n1-13\\nª The Author(s) 2021\\nArticle reuse guidelines:\\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\\nDOI: 10.1177/1524838021991306\\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tva'),\n",

WGSS are\\ndefined as\\na structured place where women and girls’ physical and emotional\\nsafety is respected and where women and girls are supported\\nthrough processes of empowerment to seek, share, and obtain\\ninformation, access services, express themselves, enhance psycho-\\nsocial wellbeing, and more fully realize their rights. (Gender-\\nBased Violence Area of Responsibility [GBV AoR] and UNFPA,\\n2019)\\nWGSS programs generally aim to achieve five objectives: (1)\\nprovide an entry point for survivors to receive information,\\nsupport, and health and protection services; (2) access\\nresources to help mitigate the risk of violence; (3) build knowl-\\nedge and skills on a wide range of topics; (4) enhance women\\nand girls’ social networks and offer psychosocial support; and\\n(5) facilitate women and girls’ empowerment (GBV AoR and\\nUNFPA, 2019; Noble et al., 2019; Robles, 2014; Wachter et al.,\\n2018). The benefits of WGSS are thus thought to encompass\\nthe human, social, physical, and financial well-being of pro-\\ngram beneficiaries (Falb et al., 2016), and it is believed that the\\nestablishment of women- and/or girl-only spaces help to reduce\\nrisks and prevent further harm during emergency responses\\n(Department for International Development, 2013).\\nAchieving these five objectives that span multiple domains\\nof well-being necessitates coordination across multiple sectors\\nof the humanitarian response, including health, security, edu-\\ncation, justice, and others. At the same time, WGSS program-\\nming is a recognized example of vertical programming to\\nensure women and girls receive safe and specialized services\\nthat meet their specific needs. While WGSS are intended to be\\nadaptable across contexts and may comprise a variety of activ-\\nities, recommended standard components of and approaches\\nfor WGSS are outlined in the recently published Interagency\\nMinimum Standards for Gender-Based Violence in Emergen-\\ncies (GBViE) Programming (GBV AoR and UNFPA, 2019).\\nThe Minimum Standards note that successful WGSS generally\\nutilize discrete referral systems and case management, support\\ngroups, recreational activities to build life skills, formal job\\ntraining, income-generating activities, and information cam-\\npaigns. Given the unique risks faced by adolescent girls in\\nhumanitarian settings as well as the difficult life transitions\\nthey may be experiencing (Stark et al., 2020), it is also recom-\\nmended that WGSS offer a safe space for adolescent girls only\\nwithin the broader safe space. In addition to linking girls to the\\nservices and activities related to the five objectives listed\\nabove, these protective spaces may provide an added dimen-\\nsion of mentorship and peer friendship for this younger popu-\\nlation (Austrian and Ghati, 2010).\\nAlthough the WGSS model has been increasingly adopted\\nby humanitarian organizations (GBV AoR and UNFPA, 2019;\\nIASC, 2006), WGSS are multifaceted and may employ a range\\nof activities, making them difficult to expand and evaluate on a\\nlarger scale. Further, no formal review of evidence supporting\\nthe use of WGSS has been conducted to date. In this article, we\\nseek to synthesize existing evidence regarding the impact and\\neffectiveness of WGSS interventions and identify remaining\\nlearning gaps related to this widely endorsed approach.\\nMethod\\nThe research team conducted a systematic literature review\\nfrom August to November 2019 to identify studies evaluating\\nthe effectiveness of WGSS in humanitarian settings. The\\nreview sought to assess the primary outcome of violence expo-\\nsure among women and girls as well as secondary outcomes\\nthat align with the minimum standard objectives outlined\\nabove. The methodology for this exercise was guided by the\\npreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-\\nanalyses standards (Moher et al., 2009). Search terms and\\neligibility criteria were guided by the study’s Population, Inter-\\nvention, Comparison, and Outcomes statement: What is the\\ncurrent evidence available on the impact and effectiveness of\\nWGSS? In order to account for all variations of the search\\nterms, Boolean search terms were used. Peer-reviewed litera-\\nture was identified through a structured search of key biblio-\\ngraphic databases, including SCOPUS, EBSCO, MEDLINE,\\nand CINAHL (see Online Supplemental Annex A), using var-\\nious combinations of women, girls, females, and safe spaces as\\nthe search terms. Records were extracted from databases if the\\ntitle, abstract, or key words included (women OR woman OR\\ngirl* OR female) within 10 words of (“safe space” OR “safe\\nspaces”) OR (WGSS). A gray literature search was also con-\\nducted from relevant organizational websites including the\\nWorld Health Organization, International Rescue Committee\\n(IRC), and UN agencies. Additionally, a hand search of quali-\\nfying articles’ bibliographies was conducted. Finally, emails\\nwere sent to organizations that have implemented safe space\\nprograms in various countries to solicit gray literature related to\\nWGSS evaluations.\\nEligibility Criteria\\nEligibility criteria for study inclusion comprised the following:\\n(i) The record was published in English, (ii) the record stated\\nthe use of a safe space intervention that explicitly focused on\\nactivities meant to achieve at least one of the five objectives\\noutlined in the Minimum Standards (GBV AoR and UNFPA,\\n2019), and (iii) the study was published in 2004 or later (see\\nOnline Supplemental Annex B for complete inclusion/exclu-\\nsion criteria).\\nHumanitarian settings were defined as contexts explicitly\\ndescribed as pertaining to refugees, armed conflict, or natural\\ndisasters, in accordance with the definition of humanitarian\\ncontexts used in other similar studies (Cerna-Turoff et al.,\\n2019; Noble et al., 2019; Rubenstein et al., 2020; Vu et al.,\\n2014). Other terms that were used to refer to WGSS within the\\nrecords included “women-friendly safe spaces” or “women-\\nfriendly spaces”; however, these terms were not included in\\nthe search strategy.\\n2\\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)'),\n",

During the\\ninitial screening, records were reviewed for inclusion of the\\nphrase “safe spaces.” If the term “safe spaces” was included\\nin the title or abstract, the context was analyzed to determine\\nwhether the evaluation referred to a WGSS intervention that\\nimplemented activities according to the inclusion criteria men-\\ntioned previously. Systematic and literature reviews were\\nexcluded from full-text review but were used for bibliography\\nhand searches. Records that discussed safe space activities but\\nwhere settings were unspecified were included for full-text\\nreview. A total of 567 records underwent full-text review,\\nwhile those determined not to fit the study’s inclusion criteria\\nwere removed. After full-text review, seven records met all\\ninclusion criteria and were analyzed for this review. Two\\nreviewers conducted the initial screening and full-text review\\nof all included articles, and a third reviewer adjudicated any\\ndifferences between the two reviewers in both rounds.\\nResults\\nAmong the seven studies that met our final inclusion criteria,\\nonly one included women as primary participants while all\\nseven targeted adolescent girls. All seven interventions\\nemployed mentor-facilitated life skills programming, and four\\nalso provided caregiver sessions to supplement adolescent pro-\\ngramming. Topics discussed during sessions varied by program\\nand included gender-based violence, social network building,\\nreproductive health, personal and menstrual hygiene, and\\nfinancial literacy. Two interventions were implemented in Asia\\n(Pakistan and Bangladesh) while the remaining interventions\\nwere conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (Uganda, Kenya,\\nTanzania, Ethiopia, and Democratic Republic of the Congo\\n[DRC]). All seven evaluations employed a mixed methods\\napproach to collecting data; however, only quantitative data\\nwere analyzed for this review.\\nIntervention Components\\nAll seven studies employed various activities based on the safe\\nspace model, including life skills curricula, mentorship, and\\ncaregiver-targeted trainings/activities. However, only activities\\nwith clearly articulated and measured outcomes were reviewed\\nfor the purposes of this study. Six of the studies’ intervention\\nactivities were further reviewed to determine which of the\\nMinimum Standards objectives were met.

The Adolescent Girls’ Program pre–post\\nanalysis (IRC, 2013) evaluated the effects of a safe space pro-\\ngram in Ethiopia.

Activities were implemented\\nover an 11-month period at Kyaka and 12 months at Nyaru-\\ngusu. The Kyaka program focused on promoting financial self-\\nreliance among adolescent participants as a way to increase\\ntheir resilience in the face of violence. While the Nyarugusu\\nreport did not explicitly mention which topics were discussed\\nduring programming, the evaluation sought to determine its\\nimpact on adolescent participants’ “livelihood skills and finan-\\ncial assets, access to safety nets, and their sense of safety.”\\nThe final intervention reviewed, the WGSS program for the\\nRohingya Refugee Response report (Seema & Rahman, 2019),\\ndiscussed preliminary results from a safe space program in\\nCox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh. Numerous activities and services\\nwere provided, including referrals to health services, psycho-\\nsocial counseling, separate groups for women and girls where\\nparticipants discussed topics of empowerment and agency,\\nlivelihood skills training, and basic literacy/numeracy.

Additionally, the Rohin-\\ngya program sought to measure the feasibility and overall\\nsatisfaction of the intervention from the point of view of the\\nwomen and adolescent girl participants and service providers.\\nWhile the evaluation’s research question was not meant to\\nmeasure the impact of the intervention on health and psycho-\\nsocial outcomes, the report did discuss changes in women’s and\\ngirls’ attitudes toward rites of passage and sense of agency/\\nempowerment.

While the\\nCOMPASS Ethiopia evaluation reported no significant effects\\non improvements in adolescents’ psychosocial outcomes and\\nexposure to violence, it did report improvements in attitudes on\\nrites of passage, social support/networks, and child marriage—\\nimportant markers along the articulated theory of change. For\\ninstance, safe space participants exhibited greater odds of\\nbelieving in delaying marriage and child-rearing until after the\\nage of 18 (adjusted odds ratio [aORs] of 1.88 and 2.04, respec-\\ntively). As with Ethiopia, COMPASS DRC reported no signif-\\nicant effects on primary outcomes of interest. However,\\ncaregivers’ outcomes improved through decreases in the Par-\\nental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire subscale scores\\n(Rohner et al., 1978), showing that caregivers exhibited greater\\nwarmth and affection and lower overall rejection compared to\\nthe control group.\\nCOMPASS Pakistan also reported improvements in atti-\\ntudes on rites of passage and social support/networks, with safe\\nspace participants exhibiting greater odds of believing girls can\\nwork outside of the home after marriage and that girls should\\nhave the same opportunities as boys (aORs of 1.39 and 1.43,\\nrespectively). COMPASS Pakistan reported improvements in\\nadolescents’ psychosocial outcomes, measured using the\\nRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1979) and the Chil-\\ndren’s Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1997), though effect sizes\\nwere minimal. For instance, while the study noted statistically\\nsignificant increases in median self-esteem and hope, both val-\\nues were still within the medium range of positive perception of\\nself-capacity to achieve goals (Bickman et al., 2010).\\nUsing w2 tests, the Adolescent Girls’ Program pre–post eva-\\nluation reported statistically significant improvements in parti-\\ncipants’ psychosocial outcomes, social network-building skills,\\nperceptions of gender norms, and reproductive health knowl-\\nedge. However, while the evaluation reported a statistically\\nsignificant increase in the proportion of participants who knew\\nwhere to receive reproductive health services (from 19% to\\n100%), values of statistical significance and detailed descrip-\\ntion of study methods were not provided within the report,\\npreventing reviewers from being able to discern the validity\\nof the results.\\nThe Kyaka II Settlement, Nyarugusu Camp, and WGSS for\\nthe Rohingya Refugee Response evaluations lacked rigorous\\nevaluation components, including the use of appropriate statis-\\ntical methods.

Some\\ncriteria were not reported on in four of the records and are\\ndenoted as such within Table 3.\\nThe quality of the COMPASS studies varied, with Ethiopia\\nmeeting all seven criteria, DRC meeting six, and Pakistan\\nmeeting three. Reasons for COMPASS Pakistan’s lower score\\nwere its small sample size (n ¼ 78), low response rate (40.6%),\\nand its nonuse of comparison groups. The Kyaka II Settlement,\\nHagadera, Nyarugusu, and Rohingya Refugee Response\\nreports scored low using this assessment tool as many of the\\ncriteria were not reported on, making it difficult to discern\\nwhether the criteria were or were not met.\\nDiscussion\\nThe present review identified only seven studies evaluating\\nWGSS in humanitarian contexts. This significant gap in the\\nevidence suggests that efforts within the humanitarian sector\\nto address the needs of women and girls through WGSS have\\nnot been based on a quantitative understanding of program\\nimpact or effectiveness. The limited evidence that emerged\\nthrough this review suggests moderate improvements among\\nadolescent girls between the ages of 10 and 19 years old for the\\noutcomes measured. This finding is an important step forward\\nfor a population often overlooked by both the child protection\\nand GBViE sectors due to an intersection of vulnerabilities\\nrelated to their age and gender (Mootz et al., 2019; Stark\\net al., 2020). At the same time, the majority of evaluations did\\nnot include adult women, thus excluding a large proportion of\\nthe target population for WGSS programs, and those who also\\nexperience high levels of violence. Such realities highlight the\\nneed for inclusion of women in evaluations to ensure a robust\\nevidence base for programming that purports to attend to their\\nunique needs (United Nations Office for the Coordination of\\nHumanitarian Affairs [OCHA], 2019).\\nSignificant variation was observed among the studies’ meth-\\nodological dimensions. Given the numerous positive impacts\\nWGSS are intended to confer on women and girls, the range\\nof primary and secondary outcomes observed in the included\\nevaluations was expected. However, the lack of concordance\\nacross studies in how similar outcomes were operationalized for\\ndata collection and analysis made comparisons difficult. Further,\\nwhile four studies omitted vital information concerning the\\nresearch methodologies applied, these records nonetheless\\nreported positive impacts of their programming. The establish-\\nment and reporting of standardized outcomes and measurement\\nparameters may help to systematically boost the evidence base\\naround WGSS (Ager et al., 2013; Augustinavicius et al., 2018).\\nAn examination of the studies extracted in the original\\nsearch, but deemed ineligible for inclusion in the final review,\\nalso highlights areas for improvement in future implementation\\nand evaluations of WGSS. The majority of records in the gray\\nliterature were excluded because they failed to provide infor-\\nmation beyond program outputs (including access to care,\\nawareness of program, and satisfaction with services). Program\\nimplementers may be able to better conceptualize and define\\nprogram outcomes through the development of a theory of\\nchange specific to a particular WGSS. Given the five related\\nbut distinct objectives of WGSS, as well as the range of activ-\\nities that can be included in programming, it can be difficult to\\ndistill all of these complexities into a one-size-fits-all theory of\\nchange. However, in their recently released guidance document\\nfor WGSS, IRC and the International Medical Corps provide a\\ntheory of change template for organizations to think through\\naccording to the specific goals they hope to achieve and\\nactivities and approaches they plan to employ (Megevand &\\nMarchesini, 2019). The COMPASS program in Ethiopia\\n(Stark, Asghar, et al., 2018) and multipronged VAWG inter-\\nventions in Rwanda (ActionAid, 2018) and Lebanon (Marsh\\net al., 2016) offer examples of interventions that leveraged\\nprogram-specific theories of change to help organize and\\ndefine how program plans alight with outcomes of interest.\\nExcluded studies also point to a need for greater cross-sector\\ncoordination in defining WGSS, as definitions and components\\nof WGSS were inconsistent across sectors and settings.\\nFurthermore, the limited results included in this review under-\\nscore previously cited concerns about the lack of technical\\nexpertise in GBViE programming on the ground, which further\\ninhibits evaluation capacity (UNICEF Multicountry GBViE\\nProgramme Evaluation: Annexes 3–18, n.d.).\\nThe paucity of evidence may also stem, at least in part, from\\na consistent lack of donor funds being directed to women and\\ngirls’ safety. Indeed, recent analyses show only 0.12% of all\\nhumanitarian funding granted from 2016 to 2018 was directed\\ntoward VAWG programming (Marsh & Blake, n.d.). Such\\nfunding gaps force the sector into the position of having to\\neither withhold services from women and girls to ensure ade-\\nquate funding for research and learning or to implement pro-\\ngramming that is not evidence-based. Having to make such\\ndecisions is both unethical and a disservice to women and girls.\\nIn what may be a more positive sign of progress, four of the\\nstudies identified through this review were published in the past\\n2 years, potentially signaling an emerging interest in equipping\\nresearchers and practitioners with the funding and data needed\\nto better advocate for effective interventions. Similarly, we\\nnote recent large-scale programs such as “What Works to Pre-\\nvent Violence” (n.d.) and the “Global Partnership to End Vio-\\nlence Against Children” (n.d.), which signal significant\\ninvestments in distilling evidence-based practice.\\nAs researchers and practitioners continue to invest in more\\nrigorous evaluations of WGSS, it will be important to plan for\\nlonger term follow-up in order to assess the impact of program-\\nming over time. While the initial evidence presented in this\\nreview hints at certain positive impacts of WGSS in humani-\\ntarian settings, none of the included studies measured any out-\\ncomes at time points beyond those collected immediately\\nfollowing WGSS participation.

The recent release of the Interagency Min-\\nimum Standards for GBViE programming provides a valuable\\nstarting point for this standardization process—both for pro-\\ngram implementation and for evaluation. While the Minimum\\nStandards focus predominantly on process indicators, they do\\noffer a common definition and a coherent framework for\\nWGSS as a holistic package of services. A complementary tool\\nkit offers further guidance on WGSS implementation, monitor-\\ning, and evaluation—an important step in elucidating how to\\nevaluate WGSS (Megevand & Marchesini, 2019).\\nBoth of these sets of guidance may offer a clearer frame-\\nwork for the way in which WGSS programming is presented\\nand evaluated in the literature moving forward. Importantly,\\nthe evaluations reviewed provided data on select components\\nof WGSS. The humanitarian sector has also seen recent\\nadvances in evaluations of Child Friendly Space (CFS)\\nprogramming—a child protection intervention that uses similar\\ncomponents to those typically contained within the WGSS\\nmodel, although not designed as a VAWG intervention (Ager\\net al., 2013; Hermosilla et al., 2019; Metzler et al., 2019). These\\nCFS evaluations were able to look at the impacts on children\\noffered by a “package of interventions.” A similar approach\\ncould be usefully adapted in tandem with the new Minimum\\nStandards to build a much broader evidence base in support of\\nWGSS.\\nAdditionally, promising evidence from similar interventions\\nin nonemergency settings, including the Empowerment and\\nLivelihood for Adolescents program in Uganda (Bandiera\\net al., 2015) and the Safe and Smart Savings Products for\\nVulnerable Adolescent Girls program in Kenya and Uganda\\n(Austrian & Muthengi, 2013), has shown these programs can\\nreduce the incidence of violence among girl participants. Simi-\\nlarly, a systematic review from Marcus and colleagues (2017)\\noutlines evidence from numerous “girls’ club” interventions\\nand life skills programs across the globe, demonstrating these\\ninterventions’ positive impacts on girls’ psychosocial well-\\nbeing (Marcus et al., 2017). Interventions that included educa-\\ntional components and financial literacy were seen to extend\\nthe beneficial impacts of “safe space” programming among\\nadolescent girls, components that carry equal relevance and\\nimportance for girls in emergency settings. Incorporating les-\\nsons learned from evaluations of comparable interventions in\\nnonemergency settings may further improve WGSS program-\\nming and effectiveness in emergencies.\\nThis review is not without limitations. Inclusion criteria for\\nthis review required that included studies involve a formal\\nquantitative evaluation of a WGSS intervention. Future\\nreviews might consider assessing evidence derived from qua-\\nlitative and participatory assessments, which can provide fur-\\nther insights on WGSS’ effectiveness. Furthermore, many\\norganizations that implement WGSS may not have the\\nresources needed to design and conduct rigorous evaluations\\nof their programs, potentially overlooking valuable contribu-\\ntions to the already limited evidence base.\\nConclusion\\nReflecting the international community’s growing prioritiza-\\ntion of keeping women and girls safe, the fifth sustainable\\ndevelopment goal calls for the elimination of violence against\\nall women and girls by 2030 (Interagency and Expert Group on\\nTable 3.

In humanitarian settings, where\\nwomen’s and girls’ risks of violence are further elevated, com-\\nmitment to reaching this goal becomes all the more critical\\n(United Nations OCHA, 2019). Despite increased program-\\nming seeking to prevent and respond to VAWG in emergency\\ncontexts, more evidence is needed to assess the impact and\\nrelative effectiveness of current approaches. Given the popu-\\nlarity of WGSS, the dearth of evaluations of this intervention\\npresents significant barriers to understanding the role these\\nprograms play in the lives of women and girls and the degree\\nto which current approaches are effective. Nevertheless, while\\nsome lessons can be learned from in-house monitoring and\\nevaluation, more robust evaluations of WGSS are still needed\\nto elucidate outcomes that benefit women and girls.

This gadget comprises of a framework that \\nguarantees double cautions if she thinks she is in a difficult \\nsituation. This framework can be turned on by a lady on the off \\nchance that she even figures she would be in a difficult \\nsituation. In a panic alarming framework, if the lady is hit on \\nthe head from behind, she may never find an opportunity to \\npress the emergency signal and nobody will realize she is in a \\ndifficult situation. Our framework tackles this issue. This \\ngadget is to be turned on ahead of time by a lady in the event \\nthat she is strolling on a forlorn street or some dull rear \\nentryway or any far off territory. Just the lady validated to the \\ngadgets can begin the framework by finger impression check. \\nWhen begun the gadgets requires the lady to continually check \\nher finger on the framework like clockwork, else the \\nframework presently sends her area to the approved number \\nthrough SMS. In this case regardless of whether somebody hits \\nthe lady or the lady tumbles down and get oblivious, she \\ndoesn\\'t have to do anything, the framework consequently sends \\nmessage when the fingerprint is missed. The gadget utilizes \\nGPS sensor alongside a GS, modem, LCD display, LoRa and \\nmicrocontroller based circuit to accomplish this framework.  \\nKeywords— LoRa, GPS, GSM, Arduino \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nProtection is a state of protection from danger and harm. \\nIn a general sense, security is closer to a concept like \\nsecurity. Another emphasis is on protecting the nuances \\nbetween the two from outward danger. Anyone or act that \\nbreaks into the condition of safety is liable for a security \\nbreach. In most cases, \"security\" is inseparable from \\n\"goodness\", but the special word \"security\" indicates that \\nsomething is not yet particularly secures, designed with \\nATmega328 for this project. This device provides women\\'s \\nsecurity Systems using GPS, GSM, LORA. Devices include \\nGPS receivers, microprocessors, and GSM modems. GPS \\nreceivers must be placed from satellites within latitude and \\nlongitude to receive information. The microcomputer \\nmeasures the data and sends this controlled data. The GSM \\nmodem interferes with the MCU for clients using the GSM \\nmodem. GSM modems send SMS to predefined versatile \\nnumbers. If a woman is at risk and needs self-defense, \\npowering on the device will immediately activate the entire \\nsystem and send location information via GSM and GPS via \\nLoRa. An SMS will be sent to that person. This system gets \\nan Arduino Mega (ATmega2560) Control system that \\nfunctions as the brain of the system because all program \\ninstructions are stored in the system. Here is a fingerprint \\nsensor to know about the authentication of authorized people. \\nIf a woman has any emergency every 5 minutes, the \\nfingerprint sensor will require a beating print of the \\nauthorized person and a warning message will be sent to the \\nparties concerned. All data transferred via LORA and \\nmonitored in the LORA receiver section. \\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY \\nBhuvaneshwari Mehtre [1] proposed “A Raspberry Pi-\\nbased Safety System for Women Security using IOT”. In this \\nsystem, they are using three ways of connecting to the \\nconcerned authorities. S. Bhuvaneswari, Akhila Krishna.D, \\nAnnapoorna. M, Gayathri. G [2] proposed that, Defense at \\nTouch – A Sensor Based Hand-Held Device for Women \\nSafety. The system provides a mechanism for the woman to \\nrespond immediately when she is in danger. Juhitha et al [3] \\ndesigned and implemented the Women Safety System Using \\nMobile Application in Real-Time Environment. They are \\ncreating mobile application. This application requires an \\nunderlying enrollment alongside Emergency contacts. \\nSanjana Babdi et al [4] proposed that, “Women’s Safety \\nUsing IOT”. This system describes Arduino Nano and a safe \\nand secure electronic system for women, including sensors \\nsuch as pulse rate sensors, accelerometers and temperature \\nsensors. The project also uses buzzers, GSM and GPS. \\nSathyasri et al [5] implemented, “Design and Implementation \\nof Women Safety System Based on IOT Technology”. This \\nsystem uses a microcontroller (ATmega2560), a buzzer, a \\nnerve simulator, a vibration sensor, a GPS module (Neo-\\n6M), an IOT module (ESP-12E), a trigger and GSM module \\n(SIM900). This system requires the device to remain \\ntriggered when a woman feels dangerous. Preethu Daniel et \\nal [6] proposed that, “Smart Band for Women Safety”. In this \\nsystem, they are using GSM, URL, Arduino, SIM800L. In \\nthis project, they have made an attempt to develop a smart \\ndevice that can assist women when they feel unsecure. This \\ndevice is a wearable band that women can wear. Dudyala \\nSunitha et al [7] tells that, “Design and Implementation of \\nWomen Safety System Based on IOT Technologies”. In this \\nsystem, they are using Mobile application, GPS Arduino, \\nMATLAB based buzzer, camera and button to activate the \\nservices. This gadget is incredibly versatile and can be \\ninitiated by the casualty on being attacked just by the snap of \\na catch that will bring her present area and also capture the \\nimage of the attacker via MATLAB based camera.

The proposed work aims at \\ndesigning IOT based safety device that relies on providing \\nsecurity to women by fingerprint-based method of \\nconnectivity to the device and alerting nearby people and \\npolice when a women is not safe. Manasa et al [9] says \\n“Smart Security Device for Women Safety”. This project \\nuses GSM and GPS modems. The system is interconnected \\nwith an alarm system to alert police stations and relatives. \\nThis detection and messaging system consists of Arduino \\nboard, a GSM modem and a GPS receiver. Jismi Thomas et \\nal [10] proposed that “Touch Me Not-A Women Safety \\nDevice”. In this system, they are using Arduino \\nprogramming, GSM module, GPS   Module, SD Module.  In \\nthis device, Button can be attached to the cloth. Imtiaz Hanif \\net al [11] tell that, “An IOT based Device for Women’s Self-\\nSecurity System to Avoid Unlawful Activities”. In this \\narticle [12], we have developed an IoT-based embedded \\ndevice that can communicate with on-demand emergency \\ncalls. \\nIII. EXISTING METHOD \\nThe mobile apps contain all the important functions such \\nas GPS tracking, emergency contact numbers, instructions on \\nsafe places, etc. The app also corrects the safe areas and their \\nsafety values that are available at the time of a problem. It \\nalso allows users to identify unsafe areas and help others. A \\npanic button sends a radio signal when pressed and alerts you \\nin an emergency. Wearable devices are used to keep track of \\ninformation in real time. They have motion sensors that take \\nthe snapshot and synchronize it with mobile devices. The \\nbell system is also used in an emergency and alerts the \\nauthorized person. \\nIV. PROPOSED SYSTEM \\nIn this framework, we use ARDUINO which goes \\nabout as mind of the framework, on the grounds that the \\nwhole framework program is guidance put away in it. Here \\nwe have fingerprint sensor to know about authentication of \\nthe authorized person. If women have some emergency \\nsituation every five minutes fingerprint sensor needs thump \\nprint of the authorized person and alert message will send to \\nthe concern person. All the data is transferred through LORA \\nand monitored at LORA receiver section. The block diagram \\nof the transmitter is shown in figure 1 and the monitoring \\nsystem shown in figure 2. \\nFig. 1. Block diagram of the Transmitter \\nFig. 2. Monitoring Section \\nList of Modules:  \\nThe lists of modules required for the device are, \\na. \\nArduino Uno  \\nb. GPS \\nc. \\nLCD DISPLAY  \\nd. GSM \\ne. \\nFingerprint Sensor \\nf. \\nLoRa \\nA. Arduino Uno: \\nArduino Uno is a microcontroller board that \\nsupports ATmega328P. It has 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz \\ncrystal oscillator, a USB port,14 digital input/output pins, \\npunch sockets, connections, ICSP connectors and push \\nbuttons, including everything who wants to help a \\nmicrocontroller; just Connect it to PC via USB connection, \\nor force it to start with an DC/AC connection or battery. \\nB. GPS: \\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) can be a satellite \\nnavigation system that provides the user with the overall \\nlocation and time information of weather conditions. GPS \\nsatellites orbit the earth exactly twice a day. Each satellite \\ntransmits specific signals and specific orbiting boundaries so \\nthat GPS devices can interpret and process the exact area of \\nthe satellite. The GPS device uses this data and conversations \\nto find the customer’s area of attention. Basically, a GPS \\nreceiver estimates the position of each satellite based on how \\nlong it takes to receive a communication signal. By \\nmeasuring the distance over satellites, the receiver can \\ndetermine the user's location and display it electronically. \\nStay on the road, pull a golf course, live at home, or explore \\nall.  \\nC. LCD Display: \\nThe 16x2 LCD means it can show 16 characters per \\nline so there are 2 lines. Each character of this LCD is \\ndisplayed on a 5x7 pixel screen. This LCD has 2 registers, in \\nparticular, data and command. The command record stores \\nits instructions provided on the LCD. The command is a \\nguide provided by the LCD to perform pre-specified tasks \\nsuch as starting it, display control, setting the directional \\nposition, display control, clearing its screen as well as the \\ndata log stores the information displayed on the LCD screen. \\nThe data is ASCII evaluation of the features displayed on the \\nLCD. \\nD.

With the expansion of GSM usage, the benefit class \\nscale has produced a much broader discourse that includes \\nsome of the most common applications, machine tools, and \\nmachine-to-machine exchanges. It operates at a frequency of \\n900MHz -1800MHz. \\nE. Sensor: \\nThe R305 fingerprint module includes a unique visual \\neffects sensor, high-speed DSP processor, fingerprint scanner \\noptimization, advanced FLASH and other tools and \\nprogramming and programming, stable execution, vertical \\nmode, fingerprint viewing, image preparation, fingerprint \\nviewer, search and save storage and other work. \\nFingerprinting involves two components: the fingerprint \\nimage object and the fingerprint coordinator (the coordinator \\ncan be 1: 1 or 1: N). When writing, the client needs to \\nfingerprint several times. The technique will capture two \\nimages of the cross finger, depending on the result prepared \\nand the format storage. \\n \\nF. LoRa: \\nLORA (Long Range) is a balanced strategy for a large \\nnetwork with low power consumption. This is due to the \\ndiffusion classification methods derived from CSS. Lora uses \\nunlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands such as 433 MHz, 865 \\nto 867 MHz (India), 868MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (Australia \\nand North America), and 923 MHz (Asia) Consume less \\nelectricity. The technology covers the body but other \\ntechnologies and protocols like the LoRa WAN cover upper \\nlayer. Depending on the spreading factor, data rates between \\n0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s can be achieved. The LoRa device \\nuses geographic functions to subdivide device locations \\nthrough door-to-door clocks. \\nV. RESULTAND DISCUSSION \\nFig. 3.

There \\nare some savage monsters in this beautiful world that does kidnapping, harassment and what not. \\nThere are apps out there which gets the location and sends a message to the nearby police station, \\nfamily and friends but these kind of things always tend to happen when they're all away. So it will be \\ntoo late for the police to reach the scene. Have any kidnaps been seen nearby a police station? Of \\ncourse not!. They dare to do these by thinking that no one sees them. Well let's say no to that \\nanymore. \\nThe solution is ‘SENTINEL’. The Sentinel app alerts the locals of that particular area where the \\nvictim is stuck with just a click of a button. It will keep the victim informed about how may rescuers \\nare alerted, how many are on-scene and whether the police are alerted or not. The locals are \\nresponsible to keep their area safe. So in turn this app gives them a chance to prove it and be the \\nhero of their own locality. \\n \\nKey-words: GPS, Flutter, Live Location, Streaming, Women’s safety, MVVM, Cloud Computing, \\nSentinel. \\n \\n \\n1.

Sentinel app is created for this very purpose. Within just a \\nclick of a button everyone in the surrounding is alerted and real-time location will be sent along with \\na map of live tracking movements. \\nAccording to the Annual National Crime Record Bureau’s (NCRB) Crimes against Women \\n(2019) dataset released on 29th September 2020. The dataset is altered to get the total crimes that was \\nagainst women on the mentioned year, it is clear that, there were a total of 4,67,882 crime cases \\nagainst women registered in India and there were averagely 16133.86 crimes were happening against \\nwomen. The crime rate shows an increase of 7.3% from the predecessor year(2018 – 3,78,236 cases). \\nThe registered crime per lakh women population is 62.4 in 2019 whereas in 2018 it was 58.8. \\nBy using Sentinel Application, majority of the cases can be averted, since 47.6% of the cases \\nare filed on assault, rape, kidnapping and abduction of women. \\n \\n2. Related Works \\n \\nDongare Uma et al., [1] proposed a voice activated app to send a message of the victim’s \\nlocation in a latitude and longitude format and also limited only to the pre-saved contacts and then be \\nnotified whether the messages are delivered to those pre-saved contacts or not. The audio recorder \\nrecords for a period of five minutes after the activation of the app as an evidence. The victim can also \\nmake voice calls from their contact list. The limitations are (i) the spoken keyword converted into text \\nmay or may not match the saved keyword. Victim will be in high anxiety at that moment and there \\nare chance that their voice may be shaky and might not return the correct keyword. (ii) The message \\nis delivered only to the registered contacts and these things tend to happen when they are away. (iii) \\nsay if the victim is hiding from the criminals and tries to say the voice activation keyword, the victim \\ncan be identified of their hidden location by the criminals. \\nMagesh Kumar.S et al., [2] proposed an app called IPROB which is activated when the \\nmobile recognizes the shake that is set to a predefined threshold. The app then starts recording the \\naudio. An notification is sent to the victim itself, if that is left unresponsive only then the app sends \\nthe location in a latitude and longitude format to the pre-set emergency contacts. When the alert is \\ntriggered, the guardian’s phone then repeats an continuous alert of “YOUR CHILD IS IN TROUBLE \\nPLZ HELP… PLZ HELP…”. If the guardian’s phone is set to silent, it automatically overrides to'),\n",

If the guardian confirms, then the emergency services are contacted and it \\ncontacts the victim’s devices and sets to speakerphone mode. The limitation are (i) the app sends the \\nlocation as a message by using a network provider and cannot be streamed as a live location. (ii) If \\nthe victim is hiding from the criminals and starts an alert, the app will compromise the victim’s \\nposition by enabling to speakerphone when guardian responds. \\nVaijayanti Pawar et al., [3] proposed an app called SCIWARS - Spy Camera Identification \\nand Women Attack Rescue System. It has two modules. The first one is when an infrared ray is \\nidentified, the user is then notified and it is up to the user to file an complaint or not. The second one \\nis when the victim continuously presses a button then a message of their location in a latitude and \\nlongitude format is sent to the pre-saved contacts only. The app then starts capturing images for 45 \\nseconds and is stored in the phone’s storage for evidence. The limitations are (i) the alert message is \\nsent only to the registered contacts. (ii) No matter how secretly the app saves the image files in the \\nphone’s storage, if the app’s data is cleared, all of the related files to the app will be deleted so the \\nevidence will be lost. \\nBhaskar Kamal Baishya [4] proposed an app to provide security. It has 2 modules. The first \\nmodule works when the victim presses the SOS button, the app then sends a message of their location \\nonly to the pre-saved contacts. The second one is integrated with microcontroller for the safety of \\nbelongings and senior citizens. If the microcontroller detects an unusual activity, the app then notifies \\nthe user and if the user responds, an alert is triggered. If the user does not respond under the defined \\ntime interval, then an automatic message is sent to interrupt the microcontroller for an alarm. The \\nlimitation is that the app sends a message with latitude and longitude only for the registered contacts \\nyet again. \\nDr. Sridhar Mandapati et al., [5] proposed an app called ISafe App. When an alert is triggered, \\nthe app then sends a message of their location in a google map link format to the pre-saved contacts \\nonly. The app also has audio, video calls, first-aid help, fake call options. It also has a option to send \\naudio – video recording via email (or) gmail if in case the user is not in a position to be able to speak \\nabout their situation. The limitations are that (i) it sends a location with a google Map link and is \\nredirected to the map only with the last known location of the user and (ii) We cannot expect people \\nto check their emails at times like these and even if they do, the victim will be unknown to the status \\nof the email whether the email has been read or not and whether the help on the way or not. \\nS.

Vamsi Priya. K et al., [12] proposed a gadget for the safety of women. The gadget is \\nactivated with a press of a button. It can be worn as a band or a watch. When activated, a SMS is sent \\nto the pre-saved emergency contacts and also to the police. The limitations are (i) the location is \\nshared only with police and registered emergency contacts so there will be delay to reach the scene as \\nthere are 8 out of 10 chances they are far away from the victim, (ii) the location is sent is only with \\nthe last current location, no dynamic location updates are done. \\nR.R. Khandoker et al., [13] proposed an app called Lifecraft. It is activated either with voice \\nor by a click of button.

The \\nmessage will be repeated to the pre-saved contacts for every 5 minutes with location update. It also \\nshows the victims, a safe zone and it also provides offline mode. The limitations are (i) the SMS with \\nlocation is sent only to the pre-saved contacts. (ii) The SMS with the location is updated only for \\nevery 5 minutes which is a huge delay. (iii) The apps suggested safe zone cannot be trusted as these \\nkind of criminal activities takes place mostly on the non-suspect areas. \\nN.

While the other \\ntwo buttons, functions the same way but the purpose are different. One is for when victim got \\nsnatched while the other is for when the user got kidnapped. The limitations are: (i) it is not feasible \\nfor the victim to have this gadget with themselves every day. (ii) The three separate buttons which \\nbasically does the same function will not be of great help to the victim. It will just put the victim in a \\ndilemma in the distress moment. \\nB.

It also \\nsends the location as an SMS to police control room and to pre-saved contacts on the microcontroller. \\nIt is trackable using google maps. The limitations are: (i) making a loud noise is not of any good to \\nthe victim if the potential crime scene is happening somewhere deserted place where most of the \\ncases takes place usually.

It has features like showing the \\nuser whether there is an internet connection or not with respective screens, the app will not use any \\nsound so that the victim can be stealthy. The help is just a button away. All that user have to do is \\npress a button at the time of distress, then a horde of people will be alerted around the neighborhood \\nwith the victim's details on their screen like name, contact, and their current live location.

The collections are areas, records and users. \\nThe users collection will hold every registered user unique id as documents and each of those \\ndocuments will have details like name, contact and home location as fields respective of those users. \\nThe victim module begins with a registration if the user is a member or login if the user \\nalready exists. The user will be presented with a screen with a alert button which is the home page of \\nthe app. In times of distress, the victim can just press the button to summon sentinels in their current \\narea locality. The screen shows the victim with how many sentinels have been notified. \\nWhen the victim decides to end their alert call, the victim should press the cancel button then \\nthe app would ask the victim to enter their passcode that only they knew when they registered. If the \\npasscode matches the alert will end. The areas collection will hold areas as the documents and each of \\nthese areas will hold details like alert ID, help, victim’s Latitude and Longitude, victim’s Location, \\nvictim Mobile Number, victim Name and their unique ID as fields. \\nThe records collection will again hold areas as the documents and each of these areas will \\nhold map of alerts under each map, there will be a record of how many people reached the scene, who \\nreached the scene and the victim Name with their unique ID as fields. \\n• \\nThe users collection are responsible for the collection of users registered.  \\n• \\nThe areas collection are responsible to continuously check for an alert call and to hold the \\nalert details.\"),\n",

The app also detects which sentinels reached the scene by calculating the \\ndistance between sentinel’s and victim’s latitude and longitude using the haversine formula. So, \\ntherefore when a sentinel is 10 meters near the victim, their user unique id is collected in the records \\ncollection under the area name as the document.  \\nThe distance is calculated by using the following function: \\nThe function takes the victim’s and sentinel’s latitude and longitude as the input.

Result and Analysis \\n \\nThe result can be concluded by analyzing the test cases. First case is that when the family, \\nfriends and police are all away from the victim at the time of distress at least a minimum of 20 km or \\nworse case way more than that. So even if the victim decides to send an SOS Alert to the pre – \\nregistered contacts, it will be too late for them to reach the scene on time which decreases the \\nprobability of surviving for the victim. As for every 1 minute delay, the probability decreases by 1%. \\nThe second test case is that when the victim has the sentinel app and starts an alert, the people’s \\nresponse time would be way faster than the other ways. Every single one in the region will be alerted \\nand everyone will be aware how many people have reached the scene and whether the information \\nhas reached the police. As seen in Fig.13, with the increased response time, it dramatically increases \\nthe survivability rate along with it. \\n \\nFig. 13 - Survival Probability vs Response Time (Sentinel vs Other Apps) \\n \\n \\nFrom the following fig.14, it is safe to say that whoever is nearby can reach the victim as \\nfaster than the others and can prevent the threat from happening.'),\n",

The primary issue in the \\nhandling of these cases by the police lies in constraints preventing them from responding quickly to calls of distress. These \\nconstraints include not knowing the location of the crime, and not knowing the crime is occurring at all at the victim’s end, \\nreaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a challenge.To avoid these situations, this paper introduces a mobile application \\ncalled ”Spark Women” that provides women with a reliable way to place an emergency call, Message and location update to the \\npolice and also to the close relatives of her family.The user can easily press the PANIC button on the screen of the app so that the \\nrespective people can receive all alerts. This paper describes the application, its development, and its technical \\nimplementation.

The National Crime Records Bureau of India reported that a woman is assaulted in the country every \\nthree minutes. The police are not able to help, as information about the crime does not reach them in time. With the number of \\ncriminal acts towards women increasing day by day so it is evident that a solution is required from the technical community to \\ntackle the situation. Presently mobile application advancement assumes a signif- icant part with working frameworks like Windows, \\nAndroid, and IOS etc. Spark Women App might be a way to provide women safety by enabling them to place an emergency call to \\nthe police in a quick, discreet way. The use of the application is divided into three steps: input of emergency contacts, triggering of \\nthe alarm, and transmission of an emergency message and call to the local police. The message contains the user’s current \\ngeographical location, and a statement that “I Am In Trouble”. This portable application is fundamentally utilized for women’s well \\nbeing. It can be utilized to discover and help women’s in crisis circumstance. It demonstrates the correct area where the individual is \\nfound and send the point of Women Safety Device With GPS Tracking System Using Arduino, 2022 interest through Short \\nMessage Service (SMS) to her relatives, guardian and friends. Spark Women app will inform and update your dear ones if you are \\nstuck in an unsafe place.It will send all the details related to your location with just a tap of a button. The app will send an SMS to a \\npre-configured number along with your location and a link of Google Maps.This app also has a section of self defence where \\nwomen can learn different techniques so that they will be prepared for protecting themselves in a way. It also has a section of some \\nbasic laws to make a women aware about her rights.It’s a very simple app to use and is important too.This clear-cut sequence of \\nevents ensures that help can be provided to women in crises as quickly as possible. Our application ensures that questions \\nregarding the user’s location or whom to contact, as well as confusion at police stations regarding where the officers must be \\ndispatched from, do not arise. [5] \\nII. \\nPROBLEM STATEMENT AND SOLUTION DESCRIPTION \\nA. Motivation \\nEvery day, women are assaulted, molested and violated on the streets of their own cities. Violence against women happens all over \\nthe world, particularly in developing countries. This violence can take many forms: physical, sexual, or psycholog- ical. [6] \\nPhysical assault on women involves the use of force to injure or endanger them. Forms of sexual assault include rape, human \\ntrafficking and forced sexual exploitation, genital mutilation, child marriage and intimate partner violence. Psy- chological abuse \\nresults in psychological trauma, which could manifest as chronic depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. The above \\nall have severe consequences on a woman’s physical and mental well-being. \\n \\nB. Problem Statement and Solution \\nThe aim of this project, is to effectively build an app for woman empowerment in our society. We tried to achieve this by making \\na mobile application that: 1) Has a simple and straightforward user interface 2) Ensures that call alert is sent to the police \\nand message alerts to both police and close friends. 3) Allows user to send location as well. 4) Allows users to learn about the \\nbasic laws and self techniques to protect themselves. The reason behind creating a mobile application to achieve the problem \\nstatement was due to the fact that a mobile phone is normally carried by everyone and is always along with any person.

APP DEVELOPMENT AND WORKING \\nThe application has been divided into two components: a front end user interface and a back-end functional unit. The user interface \\nwas developed using JavaScript, with native platform code in Java waiting for the user to engage the alert mechanism. The back-\\nend was implemented using JavaScript, alongside firebase database. Below is the Flow Diagram of our Spark Women App : [9] \\nFig. 1. Flow Diagram of App \\n \\nA. App’s Interface Design \\nThe user interface of the application is designed by keeping in mind that it should be simpler to use. The use of the application is \\nintended to be straightforward, as it would be accessed primarily in times of crisis, apart from the adding of emergency contacts. \\nThe starting interface of the app is the Get Started Page in which there is a button named Get started which will be clicked by the \\nuser and next will be the home screen of the app. [2] \\nThe home page of the application has following sections: Firstly, contacts icon is there in which user can add the emergency \\ncontacts so that those contacts can get the alerts. Then there are other icons like Self Defence, Settings and Basic laws.The main one \\nis PANIC Button which is used for all alerts to be sent to respective contacts. [7] \\n \\nB. Adding Emergency Contacts \\nWhen the user opens the application for the first time, she is asked to enter her emergency contacts so the same can be stored. \\nThe emergency contacts can be entered by adding name and phone number. Thereafter, the application will run as a background \\nservice which can be triggered in case of an emergency. [10] \\n \\nFig. 2. Starting Interface of Spark Women App'),\n",

Hence, a smart phone can be used efficiently for personal safety or various other protection purposes \\nespecially for women. This app can be activated by a single click when the user feels she is in danger. This application \\ncommuniqués the user’s location to the registered contacts for every few seconds in the form of message. Thus, it acts like a \\nsentinel following behind the person till the user feels she is safe. This paper presents analysis a unique feature of this \\napplication to send the message to the registered contacts continuously till they are pressing ‘HELP’ button. Continuous \\nlocation tracking information via SMS helps to find the location of the victim quickly and can be rescued safely. This application \\naims to ensure women safety. This is achieved by addressing the circumstances that compromise the safety of women in today’s \\nday and age. This app ensures women are not put into such situations through various features offered by our system. \\nKeywords: Smart Phone, Android, Registered Contacts, GPS location, database, URL. \\n \\nI.      \\nINDRODUCTION \\nIn today’s world, it is not safe for a person to travel alone at night especially for women; it will be high time to travel alone because \\na woman is not highly strong as men to protect herself from them. The good way to reduce chances in becoming a victim of violent \\ncrime (robbery, sexual assault, rape, domestic violence) is to identify and call on resources to help you out of unsafe situations. \\nWhether you are in instant trouble or got separated from friends during night apps on your phone can diminish our risk and bring \\nassistance when we require it. In this paper, we present Security Alert an application for smart phones working over android \\nplatform. National Crime Records Bureau of India, reported incidents of crime against women increased 6.4% during 2012, and a \\ncrime against a woman is committed every three minutes. 65% of Indian men believe women should tolerate violence in order to \\nkeep the family together, and women sometimes deserve to be beaten. In January 2011, the International Men and Gender Equality \\nSurvey (IMAGES) Questionnaire reported and do not know to reach home, having these that 24% of Indian men had committed \\nsexual violence at some point during their lives. Our motto in developing this app is to provide a safe environment to women \\nthrough smart phone as today most of the people are carrying smart phones to wherever they go. Of course, the Delhi Nirbhaya case \\nhas made the Government to make the laws tougher, but even though the sexual crime rate in India have not decreased. So, it is \\nbetter to take our own safety measures rather than becoming a victim of those crimes. This paper is organised as follows. Section– II \\ndescribes the literature survey of the existing apps and the related work of creating the application. Section – III presents the \\nproposed work and key features of the application. Consequently, the implementation of the application is described in the section \\nIV. The section – V presents the testing results of the application after installing in the smart phone. \\nFinally, section –VI concludes the paper and presents the future work for the paper explained in the Section – V and the work \\npresents the final conclusion in the Section – VI. \\n \\nII.      \\nLITERATURE SURVEY \\nAs a part of literature survey, we investigated some applications of women safety that already exist in market. The aim is to observe \\nhow these applications work and to see how they can be improved and how are they different. To date it is identified that the \\nfollowing Android Apps of women security are good and are offering relatively similar service. \\n1) Women’s Security: This app is developed by App Soft India. The key features of the app are: the user has to save some details. \\nThese details include: Email address and password of the user, Email address and mobile number of the recipient and a text \\nmessage. Then, app is loaded as a “widget”, so that when the user touches the app, it alerts the recipient. Another key feature of \\napp is that it records the voice of surroundings for about 45 seconds and this recorded voice, text message containing location \\ncoordinates of the user is sent to the recipient mobile number. [4] ` \\n2) Police Nearby: This app is developed by Big Systems in 2013.The police nearby scanner android app is built with the aim to \\nconnect citizens & students to their nearest police stations city wise at one click and will permit the community to become more \\ninvolved right from your Android Smart phones.'),\n",

Police nearby app is free to download without signup. [5] \\n \\nIII.      ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM \\n \\n \\nIV.      EXISTING SYSTEM \\nIn Previous application login and logout pages are provided which will time consuming at the time of emergency. These \\napplications are critical or difficult to understand their user interface. In previous app there is no such function provide for call. In \\nthis app there is no facility provide it to find nearby hospitals, police stations in emergency situation. \\nThe Problems with Existing System \\n1) The Drawbacks of the existing system is when emergency situation occurs the user cannot set the alert function. \\n2) You cannot send message if there is no balance in your mobile. \\n3) If there is no internet connection in message receiver phone then he could not search the location of that person who will be in \\ntrouble. \\n4) It does not send voice recording and does not takes any photographs video during the panic situation. \\n \\nV.      \\nPROPOSED SYSTEM \\nIn this proposed system, the user writes the message content and also selects the contacts to which the message has to be sent and \\nsave it. So, when he is in some danger by just opening the app and pressing the HELP button, the message stored will be sent to \\nthose numbers he has added in this application. So that he can \\nreceive the help in correct time. \\nADVANTAGES \\n1) Your loved ones and close friends can automatically receive text message. \\n2) Exact time of the alert triggered. Your location (with map link). \\n3) The battery level of your phone. \\n4) It monitors the frequent no of shakes in a particular locality or area and marks that particular location as DANGERZONE. \\n5) Automatic prompt for activating location. \\n6) Self-defence video for guiding victim, how to remain safe and protect in dangerous situations arising. \\n \\nVI.

It also displays some emergency numbers in case of \\nemergency to contact. The user can add multiple contacts for the SMS alert. For the call alert, the  realization of freedom. So, we are \\ntrying to The user can add new contact or the user can delete an existing contact. \\n \\n3) Module 3: Sms Alert And Location Sharing Service \\nThis is the main functionality of the project. When the user feels that she is in trouble, then the user can click the panic button in the \\napp which will alert the contacts with the SMS along with the user’s location, or if the user feels that she has no time to open the app \\nand alert, then she can just shake her phones multiple times which will automatically invoke the service and sends the alert message \\nto the predefined contacts along with location. When the user feels safe, she can stop the service also through the stop service option \\nwhich will eliminate the unnecessary exception messages. \\n \\nVII.      BLOCK DIAGRAM \\n \\n \\nVIII.      CONCLUSION \\nUnfortunately, the safety of women is in doubt and security is not concerned. Many headlines still coming across against women \\nindicates that increasing trends of such sexual assault, rapes still happening in today’s generation. Around 80 percent of women are \\nlosing confidence and have fear towards the contribute little efforts towards women which user can add any one of the numbers. \\nWhenever the user can modify the data or contacts if needed. will ensure the safety and respect for women so that she can also have \\nrights to grow equally like men. This mobile application is very much helpful for anyone. This application will help user to send the \\nSMS and Current location through GPS. The current address will be fetched and send it to any contact depending on user. Here the \\nuser can take precautions before coming to the actual danger. \\n \\nIX.      FUTURE SCOPE \\nAs the technology emerges, it is possible to upgrade the system and can be adaptable to desired environment. Because it is based on \\nobject-oriented design, any further changes can be easily adapted. For future upgrades we will be linking our application with the \\ndatabases of driver’s details, i.e. if the driver is committing any sort of crime and he or she has gone missing so we would be able to \\ntrace him by the information provided in the databases. We will be updating this feature in our app so that app can save driver’s \\ndetail which will contain information like photo, address of driver, contact details, batch assigned by the RTO and the certification \\nof vehicle details as well. We will try to add more useful modules in this app so it will more adaptive. \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] \\nC.Yi and Y.Tian Text string detection from natural scenes by structure-based partition and grouping IEEE Conf.

Introduction \\nToday’s smartphones or mobile phones function the central \\ncomputing and communication device in people’s lives. These \\nphones engraft varied sensors, together with measuring device, \\ndigital compass, GPS, and camera, enabling new applications \\nin varied domains like health care, social networks, and \\nenvironmental observation. \\nThis can be as a result of falls square measure a significant \\nhealth risk for older folks, decreasing the standard of life or \\nperhaps leading to death. The autumn detection system will be \\nwill be four categories: image-based systems, database-based \\napproach, context-aware techniques and acceleration-based \\ndetection. for instance, the advantage of image-based associated \\ncontext-aware approaches is a correct detection rate; the \\ninformation-based approach stores numerous detected user \\nbehavior into a database for numerous activities. The  \\n \\nacceleration-based detection is that the most generally used \\ntechnique, as current high-level devices integrate the \\nacceleration sensors. \\nThe planned system has 3 central components: sensing, \\nlearning, and alerting. within the within the, we have a tendency \\nto take the benefits of the information base-based approach to \\ngather realistic fall data. That is, we have a tendency to collect \\nthe important measuring device information from the mobile \\nembedded sensors and record the corresponding user behavior \\nto work out the specified parameters. within the second \\nelement, the planned system learns the link between the autumn \\nbehavior and also the collected information. within the third \\nelement, the mobile phones alert pre- conﬁgured emergency \\ncontacts through message. The experiment any investigates the \\nimpact of various locations wherever the phone hooked up, \\ntogether with chest, waist, and thigh. Finally, we have a \\ntendency to conduct in depth experiments to gauge the \\nadditional power consumption ensuing from the autumn \\ndetection software package. \\n2. Literature survey \\nC. Wang says, falls are the number one cause of injuries in \\nthe elderly. A wearable fall detector can automatically detect \\nthe occurrence of a fall and alert a caregiver or a medical rescue \\ngroup for immediate assistance, mitigating fall-related injuries. \\nHowever, most studies on fall detection to date have focused on \\nthe accuracy of detection while neglecting power efficiency and \\nbattery life, and hence the developed fall detectors usually \\ncannot operate for a long period (a year or more) without \\nrecharging or replacing their batteries. This fall detector reduces \\nits power consumption through both hardware- and firmware-\\nbased approaches. This study also incorporates several human \\ntrials to develop and evaluate the device, including simulated \\nfalls and activities of daily living. The LPFD reduces its power \\nconsumption using both hardware and firmware based \\napproaches. The parameters of the classifier were optimized to \\nachieve high but balanced sensitivity and specificity using PSO \\nin the training stage.

Sposaro says, injuries due to falls are among the leading \\ncauses of hospitalization in elderly persons, often leading to a \\nrapid decline in quality of life or death. Rapid response can \\nimprove the patient’s outcome, but this is often often lacking \\nwhen the injured person lives alone and therefore the nature of \\nthe injury complicates calling for help. This paper presents an \\nalert system for fall detection using common commercially \\navailable electronic devices to both detect the autumn and alert \\nauthorities. It is proven that fall detection algorithm makes the \\nsystem highly reliable. It is Reliable and reduce the number of \\nfalse positives mean greater adoption by emergency services. \\nAn Android-based smart phone is used with an integrated tri-\\naxial accelerometer. Data from the accelerometer is evaluated \\nwith several thresholds based algorithms and position data to \\nfigure out a fall. The threshold is adaptive supported user \\nprovided parameters such as: height, weight, and level of \\nactivity. The algorithm modify to unique movements that a \\nphone experiences as against similar systems that require users \\nto mount accelerometers to their chest or trunk. If a fall is sense, \\nthen a notification is raised for the user’s response. If the user \\ndoesn\\'t respond, the system alerts pre-specified social contacts \\nwith an informational message via SMS. If a contact responds \\nthe system commits an audible notification, automatically \\nconnects, and enables the speakerphone. Certain interactions \\nsuch as violently answering then ending a call or dropping the \\nphone can break the Thresholds can change positions. If a \\ncontact confirms a fall, an emergency service will be alerted. \\nOur system provides a realizable, cost effective solution to fall \\ndetection employing a simple graphical interface while not \\noverwhelming the user with uncomfortable sensors [4]. \\nN. Noury says that the main purpose is to automatically \\ndetect the autumn of the person from one device, worn on the \\ntrunk within the “para sagittal” plane in real time. The device \\nincludes 2 accelerometers, an 8 hits’ RISC microcontroller, a \\nbuzzer and B push button.

The common alarm systems are not \\nsatisfactory: a loss of consciousness or a faint are not detected, \\npeople suffering from the Alzheimer disease doesn’t even have \\nthe intellectual ability to launch an expert to call for help from \\nthe place he fell down [8]. \\nMihail Popescu says quite one third of regarding thirty-eight \\nmillion adults sixty-five and older fall annually at intervals the \\nUnited States of America. To handle the on top of drawback we \\nhave a tendency to propose to develop Associate in Nursing \\nacoustic fall detection system(FADE); which will mechanically \\nsignal a fall to the observance caregiver. As against several \\nexistent fall detection systems that require the monitored person \\nto wear devices like accelerometers or gyroscopes within the \\nleast times, our system is completely unnoticeable by not \\nrequiring any wearable devices. to scale back the warning rate, \\nwe have a tendency to use Associate in Nursing array of \\nacoustic sensors to urge sound supply height data. The sound is \\ntaken under consideration a warning if it comes from a supply \\nset at a height on top of two feet. victimisation the peak of the \\nsound, has drastically improved the warning rate. This \\ndedicated fall detection system relies on a linear array of audio \\nsensors. We tested our system during a pilot study that consisted \\nof a collection of twenty-three falls performed by a stunt actor \\nthroughout six sessions of regarding unit of time every (1.3 \\nhours in total). The actor was antecedently trained by our \\nnursing collaborators to fall like Associate in Nursing old \\nperson. the employment of height data reduced the warning \\nhourly rate from thirty-two to five at a 100% fall detection rate. \\nThough the warning rate has been reduced, it\\'s not fully \\ncorrected, Different array shapes(circular) are often thought-\\nabout for additional reduction of warning rate [5].  \\nJ. Dai says falls are a serious health risk that diminish the \\nstandard of life among elderly people. With the elderly \\npopulation surging, especially with aging \"baby boomers\", fall \\ndetection becomes increase. However, existing commercial \\nproducts and academic solutions struggle to realize pervasive \\nfall detection.  we propose utilizing mobile phones as a platform \\nfor pervasive fall detection system development. To our \\nknowledge, we are the first to do so. We design a detection \\nalgorithm supported mobile platforms.

Yes, we are \\ntalking about females. Women are still suffering from various \\ninequalities. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, \\nin 2015, there were over 300,000 reported incidents, a 44% \\nincrease from 2011 crimes against women. They are the \\nfoundation of any economy essentially forming the eventual \\nfate of the nation. She who earlier stayed at home to attend her \\ndomestic duties is now maintaining work and home \\nsimultaneously, participating in the process of economic \\ndevelopment on an equal footing with men. \\n So, it is the time to think about their safety and it is \\npossible through IoT (Internet of Things). The main answer for \\nthe issue can be taken so that the women ought to be allocated \\nwith a well-being device that is convenient and guarantees her \\nsecurity. Our task centers around giving a Smart contraption \\ndependent on IoT arrangements that not just serve to female \\nget away from the basic circumstances but also additionally \\nguarantees to give equality to the women. \\nIoT is the colossal number of interconnected gadgets over \\nthe web fit for overseeing computerized undertakings adroitly \\nwith no direct human inclusion. As time is passing, an ever-\\nincreasing number of gadgets are being interconnected and IoT \\nis turning into an indispensable piece of our lives which \\npermits us to play out the day by day undertakings quicker and \\nproficiently, and in manners, we couldn't previously. In a \\nperfect world, IoT will upgrade the future schedules with \\ncanny and solid frameworks that will make our way of life \\ncalm and furthermore adjust to the ever-developing needs. It \\nwill empower us to have totally robotized frameworks that will \\nhave its applications in making our security courses of action \\nastute, by evacuating the client obstruction with any security \\ngadget. More or less, IoT has the ability to meet all our needs \\nbefore we even acknowledge what we need and will require. \\nSecurity and interconnectedness are the genuine powers of IoT \\narrangements. Wearable security gear is another area that \\nneeds more research to have such progressive services to be \\nfitted in ordinary wear however the arrangement may exist in \\nIoT. \\nThis is made possible by our device which not only is \\nequipped with all the safety requirements but also sends the \\nmessages to the pre-assigned contacts in case of a dangerous \\nsituation. The main point of this work is to build up a wearable \\ngadget for the security of women. This goal is accomplished \\nby the examination of physiological signals related to body \\nreaction parameters. The physiological signs that are \\ninvestigated are galvanic skin reaction, body heartbeat, and \\nbody vibrations. This gadget is customized to ceaselessly \\nscreen the subject's parameters and make a move when any \\nperilous circumstances introduce itself. The body vitals of an \\nindividual in dangerous situation changes and when these \\nvitals cross the ideal values a distress algorithm gets initiated. \\nThe location of an individual is sent to the desired contacts to \\nget the nearest help possible autonomously. The data is sent to \\nthe cloud for the regular health monitoring of an individual. \\nTactile switches are the additional feature in the gadget which \\nmakes it more efficient. The safety device will act as a \\nguardian to the women at all times. \\n \\nII. \\nLITERATURE SURVEY \\n \\nThe following survey helped us in finding the right set of \\nsensors and modules for building our proposed model.  \\n \\n[1] This paper suggests a security system that can ensure \\nthe safety of women and provide the necessary security \\nmeasures.

Block Diagram of the System \\n \\nThe proposed system in the present project work is \\nportrayed in Fig. 1.1 shown above in a highly remote manner \\nwith various blocks numbered which are explained as follows: \\n \\nBlock 1 gives knowledge about Galvanic Skin Response \\nSensor. The galvanic skin response (GSR), also named \\nElectrodermal Activity (EDA) and Skin Conductance (SC) is \\nthe measure of the unceasing variations in the electrical \\nattributes of the skin, caused by the variation of the human \\nbody sweating. \\n \\nBlock 2 gives the knowledge about Vibration Sensor (SW-\\n420 module). Vibration Sensors are sensors for calculating, \\ndisplaying, and studying linear velocity, displacement, and \\nproximity, or acceleration. Therefore, vibration analysis is \\nused as a tool to determine apparatus condition as well as the \\ndistinct location and type of complications. \\n \\nBlock 3 gives information about Pulse Rate Sensor \\n(MAX30102). Pulse rate Sensor is a well-created plug-and-\\nplay heart-rate sensor for Arduino. This Sensor determines the \\npulse rate of the person. \\n \\nBlock 4 is the GPS unit. A GPS navigation system is a GPS \\nreceiver and audio/video (AV) peripheral constructed for a \\ndistinct goal such as a car-based or hand-held device or a \\nsmartphone app. The global positioning system (GPS) is a 24-\\nsatellite navigation tool that uses various satellite signals to \\nfind a receiver\\'s spot-on earth. \\n \\nBlock 5 is the GSM unit. SIM800L module is a GSM-GPS \\ntwo in one function module. In our system we are using it to \\nsend the location of the victim along with the message to the \\ncontacts which are registered. \\n \\nBlock 6 is the manual switch 1. This tactile switch is \\npressed manually by the user in case of any emergency. \\n \\nBlock 7 is the manual switch 2. This tactile switch is used \\nby the user to instruct the beneficiary that the message which \\nwas sent previously was inaccurate and they have to just \\nneglect the message  \\n \\nThe microcontroller used is NodeMCU. NodeMCU is an \\nopen-source IoT platform. It consists of peripheral which runs \\non the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems and \\nhardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. The word \\n\"NodeMCU\" by default refers to the peripheral rather than the \\ndevelopment kits. \\n \\nIV. \\nWORKING \\n \\nThe complete working of the proposed system can be \\ndivided into different modules which are as follows: \\n \\na) Database Module: - The user requires to provide \\nthe emergency contact numbers into the system which will be \\nsaved in the code. The code used will also save the messages \\nwhich should be sent in different situations. \\n \\nb) Sensor Module: - The system separately applies \\nthe distress algorithm if the sensor module develops values \\ngreater than the threshold. As soon as the algorithm is applied \\nsystem delivers the message along with the user location to the \\nsaved contacts. At the receiver just by ticking on the location \\nlink given in the message it can display the location on the \\nGoogle map in terms of latitude and longitude. \\n \\nc) Global Positioning System (GPS) module: - It is \\nnavigation and accurate positioning tool. It records the location \\nin the form of longitude and latitude.   \\n  \\nd) GSM System Module: - Global System for Mobile \\ncommunication (GSM) SIM card is added inside the mobile \\ndevice to deliver and obtain the messages using GPRS.  \\n \\n \\n \\nInternational Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT)\\nISSN: 2278-0181\\nhttp://www.ijert.org\\nIJERTV9IS050697\\n(This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.)\\nPublished by :\\nwww.ijert.org\\nVol. 9 Issue 05, May-2020\\n1087'),\n",

Flow Chart of the System \\n \\nThe flowchart of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 2. The \\nflowchart starts with continuously taking the readings from the \\nsensors. The three Sensors will measure the body vitals \\ncontinuously. These readings will be processed through a set \\nof conditions. If the conditions are met or the recorded values \\nwill beyond the threshold value i.e. the normal ranges of the \\ndifferent sensors then the device will get triggered and the \\ndistress algorithm will get initiated.

Furthermore, women are willing to spend INR 18,800 (USD 290) per\\nyear more than men for a route that is one SD safer – an amount equal to double the average\\nannual college tuition. These ﬁndings have implications for other economic decisions made by\\nwomen.

These constraints include laws that\\nlimit women’s access to and ownership of productive assets (Rakodi 2014), poor access to credit\\n(Asiedu et al. 2013), and women bearing disproportionate responsibility for household work (Fer-\\nrant, Pesando, and Nowacka 2014). In this paper, I examine an additional constraint that restricts\\nwomen’s economic mobility – safety in public spaces.\\nStreet harassment, or sexual harassment faced in public spaces, is a serious problem around the\\nworld. In Delhi, where this study is based, 95 percent of women aged 16-49 report feeling unsafe in\\npublic spaces (UN Women and International Center for Research on Women 2013). Women incur\\nsigniﬁcant psychological costs from sexual harassment (Langton and Truman 2014) and actively\\ntake precautions to avoid such confrontations (Pain 1997). For example, 84 percent of women\\naged 40 years or younger in India said that they avoid an area in their city because of harassment\\n(Livingston 2015).\\nIn this paper, I document that women in Delhi choose to attend worse ranked colleges than\\nmen, both in absolute terms and conditional on their choice set. There can be several explanations\\nfor this observation. In a country where over 85 percent of marriages are arranged (Borker et al.\\n2017), it may be that women do not care about college quality if an undergraduate degree only\\nhas signaling value in the marriage market. It could also be that women prefer to attend a local,\\nlower quality institution because of family obligations. Another potential explanation could be\\nthat women do not like competitive environments, hence they choose not to attend high quality\\ncolleges with high quality peers (Niederle and Vesterlund 2007, Niederle and Vesterlund 2011,\\nBuser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek 2014). This paper posits another explanation: in a context where\\nthe majority of students live at home and travel to college every day, women choose to attend worse-\\nranked colleges in order to avoid street harassment. Unrelated to individual or family preferences\\nthat may result in optimal choices, street harassment imposes an external constraint on women’s\\nbehavior that could potentially lead to suboptimal choices.\\n2'),\n",

In fact, such misallocation of\\nstudents to colleges, where high achieving females sort to low quality colleges, may not only affect\\nwomen’s long-term outcomes but could also have important aggregate productivity effects (Hsieh\\net al. 2016).\\nThis paper measures the extent to which perceived risk of street harassment can help explain\\nwomen’s college choices in Delhi. For this, I evaluate the gender differential in trade-offs between\\ntravel safety, college quality, travel costs, and travel time in a model of college choice. The dif-\\nference in trade-offs captures the cost of street harassment for women, since men in Delhi do not\\nface such harassment. I provide what to my knowledge is the ﬁrst evidence of the effect daily ha-\\nrassment has on a durable human capital investment such as higher education. I also estimate the\\nﬁrst revealed preference estimates of street harassment in terms of travel costs and travel time, aug-\\nmenting existing (Aguilar, Gutierrez, and Soto 2016) and mostly ongoing research on harassment.\\nI face three key identiﬁcation challenges. First, I must deﬁne the de facto set of colleges that\\na student can actually choose from. Second, I need to deﬁne the set of routes a student could take\\nto each of the colleges in their choice set. Finally, I need to determine the perceived safety of each\\ntravel route, which needs to be a measure that is likely to capture the safety perceptions of college\\nstudents.\\nTo address the main identiﬁcation challenges, I assemble a unique dataset and exploit the set-\\nup of University of Delhi (DU). DU is an umbrella entity that is composed of several colleges\\nthat are spread across Delhi. Each college has its own campus, classes, staff, and placements\\nand operates essentially like an independent university. Admissions in DU are strictly based on\\nstudents’ high school exam scores. I infer students’ comprehensive choice set of colleges, using\\ndetailed information on 4,000 students from a survey that I conducted in DU.

Finally, I combine the information on travel routes with\\ncrowd-sourced safety data from two mobile applications. The ﬁrst mobile application, SafetiPin,\\nprovides perceived spatial safety data in the form of safety audits conducted at various locations\\nacross Delhi. The second mobile application, Safecity, provides analytical data on harassment rates\\nby travel mode. The route and safety data together allow me to assign a safety score to each travel\\nroute.\\nTo assess whether women face different trade-offs between travel safety and college quality,\\ntravel costs, and travel time compared to men, I use two approaches. First, I take advantage of\\nthe DU’s admissions procedure to approximate a random allocation of college choice sets. At DU,\\nstudents apply to all colleges in the University based on their high school exam scores. Each college\\nhas a “cutoff score” or the minimum score required to gain admission to a major in the college. I\\ncompare the choices of each student with other students of the same gender who live in the same\\nneighborhood, study the same major, and have the same admission year. Given the discrete cutoffs,\\na change in students’ relative exam scores also changes their choice sets, relative to their neighbors.\\nI ﬁnd that while women’s choices seem to take into account both route safety and college quality,\\nmen’s choices only depend on quality and are consistent with a model in which preferences are\\nlexicographic in college quality.\\nSecond, I use a combination of structural econometric methods to estimate the magnitude of\\nthe students’ willingness to pay for travel safety. I estimate students’ indirect utility function using\\na nested logit model and heterogeneity in these preferences using a mixed logit model. In my\\nbenchmark speciﬁcation, students’ indirect utility depends on college quality, route safety, travel\\ncosts, and travel time, and is allowed to fully vary by gender. The analysis uses spatial variation in\\nstudents’ location, destination colleges, route choices, mode choice and area safety. Identiﬁcation\\nis based on the assumption that the difference between men and women’s unobserved preferences\\nfor a route to a college is uncorrelated with observed college quality, perceived travel safety, travel\\ncosts, and travel time.\\n4'),\n",

DU\\nis composed of 77 colleges of which 58 offer general undergraduate majors in Humanities, Com-\\nmerce and Science.1 There are over 180,000 undergraduate students at DU (University of Delhi\\nAnnual Report 2013-14), which represents around 8 percent of all students who passed the Class\\n12 qualifying exam in India.2 DU is also the main public central university in Delhi that offers a\\nliberal arts education. Other public universities offering general undergraduate majors are either\\nsigniﬁcantly smaller in comparison or have limited overlap with the majors offered by DU.3 An-\\nother option for students in Delhi are the private universities. However, these private institutions\\nnot only offer limited courses but are also considerably more expensive than DU. For example, one\\nof the biggest private universities in Delhi charges on average 9 to 18 times DU’s average annual\\ntuition.\\nColleges in DU are spread across Delhi. Figure 1 shows the spread of colleges in Delhi. Col-\\nleges vary in the size of their student population; on average, a college has about 2,800 students.\\nUndergraduate studies at DU are for three years,4 and each college offers multiple majors. On\\n1These exclude colleges that offer professional degrees like law and medicine. Of the 58 general education under-\\ngraduate colleges, 22 colleges are women only and eight colleges are evening colleges where classes take place after 2\\npm.\\n2This represents around 6.6 percent of all students who appeared for the Class 12 qualifying exam in India.\\n3These general public universities in Delhi are Jamia Millia Islamia University, Jawahar Lal Nehru University,\\nand Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.

Jawahar Lal Nehru University offers undergraduate\\nprograms only in foreign languages.

This\\nexam on average accounts for 75 percent of the students’ ﬁnal grades. The remaining 25 percent of\\nthe ﬁnal grade is based on internal college evaluation of the student.\\nA distinguishing feature of DU is that admission to colleges is strictly based on students’ high\\nschool exam scores. Each college speciﬁes a cutoff score or the minimum percentage required\\nto gain admission to a major. Every student who scores above this cutoff score is guaranteed\\nadmission to the college. In line with previous studies (Black and Smith 2004), I use selectivity\\nin admissions as an indicator of college quality, measured by a colleges’ cutoff score. Based on\\nthese cutoff scores I am able to rank each college in absolute terms and within a student’s choice\\nset, where a higher rank indicates a lower cutoff score and hence worse quality. The absolute rank\\nrates colleges within a major and admission year using the ﬁrst cutoff list. Rank within a student’s\\nchoice set ranks the colleges to which the student was admitted by their cutoff score for the students’\\nmajor and admission year. Figures 2a and 2b show the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of\\nthe absolute rank of a college and the CDF of rank within a student’s choice set, respectively.\\nWe can see that women’s CDF lies below the CDF for men, indicating that women choose worse\\nranked colleges than men across the distribution. Women choose worse ranked colleges than men\\nin absolute terms for the most part of distribution, and they choose worse quality colleges from\\nthe ones that they were eligible to attend for the entire distribution. This is despite women scoring\\nhigher than men on exams at the end of high school, as shown in Figure 3.7\\nAnother feature of DU is that majority of the students (72 percent) live with their parents and\\nwith widespread protests and was embroiled in controversy since its implementation.

This model explicitly captures how\\nwomen might have to choose worse quality colleges in order to avoid travel by unsafe routes. In the\\n2×2 matrix in Figure 4a, the high-scoring students are in the ﬁrst row (high school exam score = H)\\nand low-scoring students are in the second row (high school exam score = L). In the columns, there\\nis a low quality “Not-so-good college” (Quality= n) and a high quality “Good college” (Quality\\n= g) with g > n. In between these two colleges there is a “danger” area that is unsafe, a travel\\nroute becomes unsafe if it passes through this unsafe area. There is an equal number of high and\\nlow-scoring males and females located in each college’s neighborhood.

This is a\\nsingle form that is used for admission to all colleges in the university. A student has to specify the\\nmajor(s) they wish to apply for. Following the submission of the form, each college releases the\\nﬁrst list of cutoff scores. The cutoff score is the minimum average percentage score a student needs\\nin high school to gain admission into a college.9 The high school scores are based on the national\\nSenior School Certiﬁcate Examinations.10,11 The college cutoff score is calculated separately for\\neach major on the basis of the seats available in a college, the high school scores of applicants\\nand the cutoff score in previous years according to the Delhi University Standing Committee on\\nAdmissions 2015. The cutoffs vary by social category,12 subjects studied in Class 12 and in some\\ncases by gender of the student.13 Following the release of the cutoff list, students have about three\\ndays to register in a college of their choice. Students are required to submit their original degree\\ncertiﬁcate and pay the ﬁrst year’s annual fees at the time of admission. The colleges are obligated\\n9The average for each student is calculated on a “best of four” basis, where most often the students can exclude their\\nlowest scoring subject while calculating the average. Most colleges require students to include at least one language in\\nthis average.\\n10The Senior School Certiﬁcate Examinations are evaluated in a double blind manner.\\n11The majority of schools in India come under the purview of the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE),\\na board of education that conducts the Senior School Certiﬁcate Examination. The only other national board is the\\nIndian Certiﬁcate of Secondary Education. Other boards of education are at the state level. In our sample over 96\\npercent of students’ board of examination was the CBSE.\\n12Social categories refers to the ofﬁcially designated groups of historically disadvantaged people in India. These\\ncategories are used for the purposes of afﬁrmative action. These are General category (Gen), Scheduled Castes (SC),\\nScheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Castes (OBC). Another category used for admissions is Physically Hand-\\nicapped (PH). Gen is the unreserved category, SC were formerly referred to as “untouchables”, ST are the indigenous\\npeople, and OBC is the collective term used by the Government to classify castes which are socially and educationally\\ndisadvantaged but not SC.\\n13In minority colleges, cutoffs are lower for students belonging to the minority religion. A few colleges also take\\ninto account the subjects studied in Class 10, mostly for language courses. A sample cutoff list is shown in Figure A1.\\nIn this cutoff list, the cutoff score are listed by college major (rows) and students’ social categories (columns). We can\\nsee that the minimum score required by a general category male student to gain admission in Economics is 95 percent,\\nfor female students the cutoff score is 1 percentage point lower at 94 percent.\\n13'),\n",

The same process is repeated until all seats in every college are\\nﬁlled. In 2015, DU released 12 cutoff lists. Based on these objective cutoffs it is possible to\\nconstruct the choice set of colleges for each student conditional on choice of major.15\\n4.3\\nChoice Set Creation\\nI construct student’s choice set conditional on major choice using students’ high school scores by\\nsubject and each college’s publicly available cutoff lists. For every student in the sample, I compute\\nan aggregate score following guidelines speciﬁed by each college in DU. If the student’s aggregate\\nscore percentage is greater than the cutoff speciﬁed by a college, then that college is in the student’s\\nchoice set. I repeat this procedure for all cutoff lists released by every college, which is equivalent\\nto using the lowest cutoff score.16 On average, a student has 22 colleges in their choice set. As\\nexpected, the number of colleges in a student’s choice set is positively correlated with their high\\nschool exam score and the cutoff score of their chosen college, as shown in Figure A2.\\nAccurate choice sets are crucial for my analysis. Most importantly, there should not be any\\nsystematic errors in choice sets by gender. Since the choice sets are created based on students’\\nreported high school exam scores, I test if there is any systematic misreporting of exam scores by\\ngender. For this, I match students from the full survey sample to the college administrative data at\\nthe one college for which I have students’ high school exam scores. The students are matched on\\nthe basis of their residential locations, genders, social categories and parental occupations.17 I ﬁnd\\n14There are some instances where colleges have claimed to run out of registration forms to prevent students from\\nregistering once the college had reached its sanctioned limit (Hindustan Times 2013).\\n15In principle, only a student with scores above the cutoff can be granted admission.

For example, some seats in every college are reserved for students who have excelled\\nin sports and extra-curricular activities, and the cutoffs for these students are not made public by all colleges.\\n16Two colleges are excluded from the analysis because they followed a different procedure for admissions.\\n17I was able to match 78 percent of the Delhi residents in my full survey sample to the administrative data for the\\n14'),\n",

I map students’ reported travel routes as a sequence of landmarks and travel modes, taking\\ninto account the departure times. The travel information collected as part of the full survey and its\\nmapping in Google Maps ﬁlls a major data gap in India, since there are no detailed travel surveys in\\nthe country. The existing data on daily travel from the Census of India is aggregated at the district\\nlevel making it impossible to study travel choices by individual attributes.18 To create students’\\npotential routes to the chosen college and the colleges in their choice set, up to four routes are\\nextracted per Google Maps based travel option, i.e., driving only, walking only and public transit,\\ngiving a total of up to 12 travel routes for every student to each college in their choice set. The\\npublic transit routes are then broken into separate legs based on travel modes. I drop students who\\nare outliers in terms of travel time and I also drop potential routes that have a travel time greater than\\nthe 99th percentile of reported travel time. Allowing for variation in departure times, the reported\\ntravel route is one of the options suggested by Google Maps between the origin and destination\\nfor over 90 percent of the students in sample.19 Ultimately, for every student I have their reported\\ntravel route and potential travel routes to the college they chose and the potential travel routes they\\ncould have taken to each college in their choice set.20\\nAn example of route mapping is given in Figure A3. Figure A3a shows a student and the college\\none college, without any conﬂicts.\\n18One exception to this is the travel survey conducted by Bansal et al. (2016) in three major cities in India.

These safety audits allow the user to characterize the safety\\nof a location based on nine parameters. The nine parameters are openness of spaces, visibility or\\n“eyes on the street”, presence of security personnel, the condition of the walking path, presence of\\npeople speciﬁcally women and children on the street, access to public transport, extent of lighting,\\nand the overall feeling of safety. The contributors can rate a location by assigning a score from\\n0 (low safety) to 3 (high safety) on each of the nine parameters. Details of each parameter and\\na description of the audit rubric are given in Table A1.

The SafetiPin data is partially crowd-sourced and partially collected by trained\\nauditors.

Safecity allows its users to record personal stories of harassment and abuse in\\npublic spaces. In these stories, the users mention the mode of transport they were using when they\\nexperienced harassment.

Table 2 provides information on mode usage by gender in the full survey data and\\nproportion of harassment reports by mode from Safecity’s analytical data. Students use a variety\\nof modes to travel to college, with 38 percent of students traveling by a public or private bus for\\nsome portion of their daily route. Men are more likely to travel by bus than women. The metro\\nis the most popular mode of transport for all college students and is more popular among women\\nby a signiﬁcant margin. Of the women who travel by the metro, 86 percent reported exclusively\\ntraveling in the ladies-only compartment. A large proportion of both men and women are likely\\nto walk some part of their travel route, with men being more likely than women to have a walking\\npart. From the last column of Table 2, we can see that, in line with anecdotal evidence, buses are the\\nmost unsafe mode of transport with about 40 percent of the harassment incidents involving a bus\\nor the people in it. This is followed by the metro which covers about 16 percent of the incidents.\\n4.6\\nCalculating Route Safety\\nI assign a safety score to the reported and potential routes by computing a weighted average of the\\narea safety data, where the weights are the proportion of a route and harassment by travel mode (m)\\nin each safety pixel (p).

The ideal experiment for this exercise would require random allo-\\ncation of college choice sets to students. Then evaluating students’ responses in terms of choice\\nattributes to the variation in their choice sets would help me better understand their underlying\\npreferences. Since I do not have full control over students choice sets, I exploit DU’s admissions\\nprocess to approximate the ideal experimental design. I use the fact that students’ high school exam\\nscores combined with colleges’ cutoff scores completely determine each student’s choice set.\\nI compare students’ choices in terms of travel safety, college quality, travel time and costs,\\nwith those of a “similar” student as their relative exam scores change. Given the discrete cutoffs, a\\nchange in the student’s relative exam score also changes their relative choice set. I deﬁne a “similar”\\nstudent as a student who lives in a 1.5 km radius neighborhood23 around the index student, is of the\\nsame gender, studying the same major and has the same admission year. A student with a greater\\nhigh school exam score faces a superior choice set in terms of college quality and a larger, though\\nnot necessarily superior, choice set in terms of route attributes compared to a neighbor with a lower\\ncutoff score. I have 2,951 unique pairs that use information on 69 percent of the students in my\\nsample.\\nTo better understand how analyzing students’ choices relative to a close neighbor can help\\nme understand their underlying preferences, consider two extreme cases. First, if students have\\nlexicographic preferences in terms of quality, then we would observe that the relative quality of the\\nindex student’s chosen college would increase with an increase in the index student’s score relative\\nto her neighbors, while the relative route safety could move in any direction. Relative travel time\\nand travel cost could also change in any direction with an increase in the index student’s score gap.\\nIn the other extreme case, if students have lexicographic preferences in terms of safety then we\\nwould observe no change or an increase in the safety difference between the index student’s chosen\\nroute relative to her neighbor’s chosen route with an increase in the index student’s relative exam\\n23The 1.5 km radius is the minimum distance for which 90 percent of the students have at least one neighbor.\\n19'),\n",

The weight students place on college quality and\\nroute safety may vary idiosyncratically and with observable student characteristics such as socio-\\neconomic status and high school academic achievement. The weight male and female students\\nplace on college quality may vary for two reasons. First, some students may simply place an in-\\nherently high value on institutional quality. Second, even if all students place low importance on\\ncollege quality, some students may face high decision making costs leading them to place lower ex-\\npressed weight on quality when determining their expected utility and selecting a college (Hastings,\\nKane and Staiger 2009). Similarly, the weight students place on route safety may vary because ei-\\nther students are inherently averse to harassment or because they face external pressure for example\\nfrom parents, to travel by safe routes. These different sources of heterogeneity cannot be separately\\nidentiﬁed in this analysis because they result in observationally equivalent choice behavior.\\nBy introducing individual heterogeneity in logit coefﬁcients, the mixed logit model allows for\\nﬂexible substitution patterns albeit by imposing more structure on the distribution of preferences.\\n25'),\n",

First, in addition to the lack of on-campus housing at DU, it is the norm that students live at\\nhome with their parents. That parents are unlikely to base their residential choices on the location of\\ntheir children’s future preferred colleges, helps to identify values placed on travel times and travel\\nsafety separately from residential sorting by focusing on the sample Delhi residents. Residential\\nsorting could overstate the importance of travel time and safety for students located near to their\\npreferred colleges.\\nSecond, the colleges in DU are spread out across the city and are located in neighborhoods with\\nvarying characteristics and with students of both genders and all socio-economic groups. Each\\nstudent faces a host of college and route choices only determined by the student’s high school\\nexam score and the colleges’ cutoff score. Figure 11 shows the characteristics of students and the\\narea around each college. Each bar represents a college and the colleges are in ascending order of\\nquality.25 Figure 11a and Figure 11b show that students with all levels of high school scores and\\nboth genders live near colleges across quality levels. There is also no sorting of colleges by quality\\naccording to the socio-economic status or safety of neighborhoods, as can be seen from Figure 11c\\nand 12d. Hence, I have wide variation in both college and student locations, providing variation in\\nroute safety for students of both genders and colleges of all quality.\\nThird, college cutoff scores do not seem to take into account women’s safety concerns. If travel\\nsafety affects the pool of students who enroll in a college, such that the number of high achieving\\nfemale students who enroll is less than what a college anticipated, it maybe that the cutoff scores\\nfor women decrease or the advantage given to them increases the following year. This could bias\\nthe safety estimate.

Using the structural estimates, I can evaluate the effects of some poli-\\ncies that are currently used and those that could be implemented. The ﬁrst best policy intervention\\nwould make public spaces safe and accessible for women such that they would face no harassment.\\nI assess the effect of such a ﬁrst best policy where all travel routes for women have the highest\\nlevel of safety observed in the data. Increasing safety of all travel routes for women improves the\\nexpected rank of their predicted college choice and women travel by cheaper but longer routes.\\nSpeciﬁcally, it reduces the average rank gap between men and women by ﬁve percent. Women’s\\ncost of travel decreases by almost 19.8 percent and their travel time increases by four percent. As\\nwe saw previously, men travel by longer and cheaper routes than women, the cost reduction from\\nan increase in travel safety closes the travel cost gap between men and women by over 28 percent.\\nAn alternative policy lever could empower women to ﬁght back, thereby inﬂuencing women’s\\npreferences for safety. This can be done in many ways, either through self-defense training, such\\nas initiatives taken by SheFighter in Egypt, or by encouraging women to reclaim public spaces\\nas in the WalkAlone campaign by Blank Noise in India, or through information campaigns like\\n’Stop Telling Women to Smile’ in several cities across the world. I estimate this in the model by\\nassuming that women and men have the same preferences for safety. While the ﬁrst best policy\\nchanges the environmental safety factor, this policy changes the preferences for different levels\\nof environmental safety. I ﬁnd that the effect of such policies is similar to the ﬁrst-best policy.\\nThe gap between men and women’s college rank reduces by four percent, and the travel cost gap\\ndecreases by 21 percent. Another intervention could be to subsidize the modes of transport for\\nsome women.36 To simulate the effect of this policy experiment, I assume that women pay the\\n36The reason I consider subsidizing travel for some but not all women is to disregard the general equilibrium effects\\n34'),\n",

While there is qualitative evidence on the negative effects of street harassment on\\nwomen’s economic mobility, this is the ﬁrst study to quantitatively assess the long term economic\\nconsequences of street harassment. By combining unique data that I collected from the University\\nof Delhi, with route mapping from Google Maps, and mobile app safety data, I study the trade-\\noffs women face between college quality and travel safety, relative to men. I ﬁnd that women face\\nsigniﬁcant trade-offs and are willing to attend a college that is 25 percentage points lower in the\\nquality distribution for a route that is perceived to be one SD safer. Men are only willing to attend a\\ncollege that is 5 percentage points lower in the quality distribution for a route that is one SD safer.\\nAdditionally, I ﬁnd that women are willing to spend an additional Rs. 18,800 on annual travel,\\nrelative to men, for a route that is one SD safer. This amount is more than double the average an-\\nnual fees at DU. Using estimates from Sekhri (2014), on the labor-market earnings advantage from\\nattending a public college, I estimate that women’s willingness to pay for safety translates to a 20\\npercent decline in the present discounted value of their post-college salaries. These results show\\nthat street harassment is an important mechanism that could perpetuate gender inequality in both\\neducation and lifetime earnings.\\nUsing structural econometric methods, I evaluate and interpret the impact of different existing\\nand potential interventions that can alleviate the impact of street harassment on economic choices\\nof women. I ﬁnd that the ﬁrst-best policy of making all travel routes safe for women reduces\\nthe average rank gap between men and women by ﬁve percent.

For instance, the global labor force participation rate for\\nwomen is 26.7 percentage points lower than the rate for men in 2017 and the largest gender gap in\\nparticipation rates is faced by women in emerging countries (World Employment Social Outlook\\n2017). The results of this paper suggest that street harassment could help explain part of this gender\\ngap. In the context of India, labor force participation rates for women aged 25-54 have stagnated at\\nabout 26 to 28 percent in urban areas, between 1987 and 2011. The fact that this is the case, despite\\nthe economic and demographic conditions that ordinarily would lead to rising female labor-force\\nparticipation rates, remains a long-standing puzzle (Klasen and Pieters 2015). This is an important\\nissue for India’s economic development. With a high share of working-age population, labor force\\nparticipation, savings, and investment can boost per capita growth rates. However, if a majority of\\nwomen do not participate, say because of the fear of harassment, then the effect will be never be as\\nstrong.\\n36'),\n",

This paper \\npresents an improved mobile application that prioritizes \\nwomen’s safety through a SIM card-based location \\ntracking approach instead of relying on GPS services that \\nrequire an internet connection. This feature ensures \\nconsistent and reliable location tracking even in areas \\nwith weak or no internet access. Inspired by existing \\nplatforms like bSafe and My Safetipin, the app includes \\nan emergency alert system that allows users to trigger \\nSOS signals to authorities and nearby registered users by \\npressing the power button, volume button, or using \\nspecific gestures. The involvement of nearby users aims \\nto provide immediate assistance before law enforcement \\narrives, potentially preventing harm or saving lives. The \\npaper features a survey and technical analysis detailing \\nthe app’s architecture, usability, and the benefits of SIM-\\nbased \\ntracking \\nfor \\nimproved \\nresponse \\ntimes \\nduring emergencies. \\n \\n \\nKey Words:  Women’s safety, SIM card location tracking, \\nemergency alert system, SOS message, offline tracking, \\nmobile safety app, user assistance network. \\n \\n \\n1.INTRODUCTION  \\n \\nEnsuring women’s safety is a critical global issue, with \\nincidents occurring daily that highlight the need for \\neffective personal security measures. The proliferation of \\nsmartphones and advancements in mobile technology \\nhave paved the way for innovative safety-focused \\napplications. However, many existing apps rely heavily on \\nGPS-based internet tracking, which can be unreliable or \\nunavailable in certain locations. This limitation can delay \\nemergency responses and reduce the efficacy of safety \\nprotocols, putting users at risk. \\n \\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a \\ncomprehensive mobile app that places user safety at the \\nforefront by using SIM card-based location tracking. \\nUnlike conventional apps that require continuous internet \\naccess for GPS services, our solution leverages cellular \\nnetworks for location tracking. This ensures consistent \\nmonitoring even in areas with limited or no internet \\nconnectivity. A standout feature of the app is its discreet \\nand accessible SOS alert capability, which can be \\ntriggered by pressing the power or volume buttons or \\nusing pre-set gestures. These alerts are sent via SMS to \\nlaw enforcement and nearby registered users, creating a \\nnetwork of responders who can assist the user before the \\narrival of police. \\n \\nThe development of this app draws inspiration from \\nplatforms like bSafe and My Safetipin but incorporates \\nenhancements that address their limitations. The main \\ninnovation is the integration of SIM-based location \\ntracking and offline alert features, which together enhance \\nreliability and responsiveness during emergencies. This \\npaper explores the app’s design, architecture, testing \\nphases, and practical applications, alongside a survey of \\nuser feedback and challenges in implementation. \\n \\nThis research contributes to the field of mobile safety \\napplications by demonstrating that SIM-based technology \\ncan serve as a robust alternative for location tracking in \\nsafety solutions. The findings aim to inform future \\ndevelopments and encourage wider adoption of offline-\\ncapable safety mechanisms. \\n \\n2. OBJECTIVE \\n \\nThe objectives of the project ‘SafeSteps’ Its intent is to come \\nup with a better and user-friendly mobile app that is focused on \\nwomen’s safety. This work seeks to assist with the growing \\nglobal concern for the online violence directed toward women \\nwherein most safety applications are limited to GPS internet \\ntracking. Such older application are not viable in places where \\nthere is little or no Internet coverage and this hinders timely \\nresponses and puts users in jeopardy. This application \\nminimizes the reliance on the internet by utilizing a SIM card \\nbased location tracking system, hence enabling tracking and \\ncommunication in remote or network poor areas. The method \\nemploys cellular approximations to locations to avoid GPS-\\nenabled locating. This function can prove useful in rural, low \\nsatellite areas giving assurance to women that they can always \\nget network help when required regardless of coverage area. \\n \\nThe main feature of this application is the SOS notification \\nsystem, which is very discreet and easy to distinguish. Users \\ncan activate this emergency function by pressing the power \\nbutton or volume button. or make a specific gesture This makes \\nit possible to send urgent notifications in the event of a crisis. \\nThese alerts can also be sent via SMS. This instant alert system \\naims to promote a faster response. Because messages reach \\nlocal responders and law enforcement simultaneously, the \\nparticipation of nearby registered users creates a community \\nsupport network. This may bring help to the user before the \\nauthorities arrive. This idea has inspired existing apps like \\nbSafe and My Safetipin, but also tailored enhancements to \\naddress the limitations of those platforms.'),\n",
