Robinson1, Ilana Seff1,2 ,\\nAlli Gillespie1 , Jonathan Colarelli1, and Debbie Landis3\\nAbstract\\nOne in three women and girls will experience violence in their lifetime. In conflict and postconflict settings, the incidence of\\nviolence against women and girls (VAWG) is exacerbated, resulting in increased negative social, economic, health, and psy-\\nchosocial effects. In an attempt to prevent and respond to the occurrence of VAWG in humanitarian settings, Women and Girls\\nSafe Spaces (WGSS) have been promoted as a promising intervention. The authors conducted a systematic review to examine the\\ncurrent quantitative evidence available on the impact and effectiveness of WGSS programs. The authors reviewed relevant peer-\\nreviewed and gray literature using predefined search terms for potential inclusion. Seven records met inclusion criteria. Records\\nincluded evaluations of WGSS programs implemented in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania,\\nKenya, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. While none of the studies reported reductions in exposure to or incidence of VAWG among\\nprogram participants, three evaluations demonstrated moderate improvements in psychosocial well-being, social support, and\\nattitudes toward rites of passage. Additionally, only three of the seven evaluations employed rigorous methodologies. This study\\nillustrates the paucity of existing quantitative evidence around the impact of WGSS and the need for further research examining\\nthe potential benefits of this widely implemented intervention for women and girls. A stronger evidence base has the potential to\\ninform policy and program development and to help governments, organizations, and communities better allocate limited\\nresources in response to VAWG.\\nKeywords\\nsafe spaces, evaluation, conflict, gender-based violence, systematic review\\nIn 1993, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly issued the\\nDeclaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women,\\nformally affirming that viole nce against women and girls\\n(VAWG) is a human rights violation and charging UN states\\nwith eliminating physical, sexual, and psychological violence\\ntargeted against women and girls (IASC, 2006; UN General\\nAssembly, 1994). In humanitarian settings, which are typically\\ncharacterized by destabilization of local infrastructure, break-\\ndown of social supports, and impunity for perpetrators, the risk\\nof VAWG is often elevated (Aas, 2010; Farr, 2009; IASC,\\n2006; Marsh et al., 2006; Robles, 2014; Stark et al., 2017;\\nUnited Nations Population Fund [UNFPA], 2019; United\\nNations, 2015). In these settings, women and girls may face\\nhigher levels of disruption to education, forced or early mar-\\nriage, exploitation, and physical and sexual violence (Stark\\net al., 2020). Sexual violence can be deployed as a conflict\\ntactic in order to displace communities, seize land and\\nresources, recruit young males, and establish repression, terror,\\nand control (El-Mouelhy, 2004; Farr, 2009; Marsh et al., 2006;\\nStark & Wessells, 2012; UN Secretary-General, 2019). Addi-\\ntionally, despite the elevated risk in humanitarian settings\\nof violence perpetrated by combatants, intimate partner vio-\\nlence (IPV) remains the most prevalent form of violence expe-\\nrienced by women and girls (Stark & Ager, 2011; Stark et al.,\\n2010, 2017).\\nIn an attempt to prevent and respond to violence experi-\\nenced by women and girls in humanitarian settings, interna-\\ntional aid organizations have promoted Women and Girls Safe\\n1 Brown School, Washington University in St. Louis, MO, USA\\n2 Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA\\n3 CARE USA, Washington, DC, USA\\nCorresponding Author:\\nLindsay Stark, Brown School, Washington University in St. Louis, Campus Box\\n1196, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130, USA.\\nEmail: lindsaystark@wustl.edu\\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\\n1-13\\nª The Author(s) 2021\\nArticle reuse guidelines:\\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\\nDOI: 10.1177/1524838021991306\\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tva'),\n",

WGSS are\\ndefined as\\na structured place where women and girls’ physical and emotional\\nsafety is respected and where women and girls are supported\\nthrough processes of empowerment to seek, share, and obtain\\ninformation, access services, express themselves, enhance psycho-\\nsocial wellbeing, and more fully realize their rights. (Gender-\\nBased Violence Area of Responsibility [GBV AoR] and UNFPA,\\n2019)\\nWGSS programs generally aim to achieve five objectives: (1)\\nprovide an entry point for survivors to receive information,\\nsupport, and health and prot ection services; (2) access\\nresources to help mitigate the risk of violence; (3) build knowl-\\nedge and skills on a wide range of topics; (4) enhance women\\nand girls’ social networks and offer psychosocial support; and\\n(5) facilitate women and girls’ empowerment (GBV AoR and\\nUNFPA, 2019; Noble et al., 2019; Robles, 2014; Wachter et al.,\\n2018). The benefits of WGSS are thus thought to encompass\\nthe human, social, physical, and financial well-being of pro-\\ngram beneficiaries (Falb et al., 2016), and it is believed that the\\nestablishment of women- and/or girl-only spaces help to reduce\\nrisks and prevent further harm during emergency responses\\n(Department for International Development, 2013).\\nAchieving these five objectives that span multiple domains\\nof well-being necessitates coordination across multiple sectors\\nof the humanitarian response, including health, security, edu-\\ncation, justice, and others. At the same time, WGSS program-\\nming is a recognized example of vertical programming to\\nensure women and girls receive safe and specialized services\\nthat meet their specific needs. While WGSS are intended to be\\nadaptable across contexts and may comprise a variety of activ-\\nities, recommended standard components of and approaches\\nfor WGSS are outlined in the recently published Interagency\\nMinimum Standards for Gender-Based Violence in Emergen-\\ncies (GBViE) Programming (GBV AoR and UNFPA, 2019).\\nThe Minimum Standards note that successful WGSS generally\\nutilize discrete referral systems and case management, support\\ngroups, recreational activities to build life skills, formal job\\ntraining, income-generating activities, and information cam-\\npaigns. Given the unique risks faced by adolescent girls in\\nhumanitarian settings as well as the difficult life transitions\\nthey may be experiencing (Stark et al., 2020), it is also recom-\\nmended that WGSS offer a safe space for adolescent girls only\\nwithin the broader safe space. In addition to linking girls to the\\nservices and activities related to the five objectives listed\\nabove, these protective spaces may provide an added dimen-\\nsion of mentorship and peer friendship for this younger popu-\\nlation (Austrian and Ghati, 2010).\\nAlthough the WGSS model has been increasingly adopted\\nby humanitarian organizations (GBV AoR and UNFPA, 2019;\\nIASC, 2006), WGSS are multifaceted and may employ a range\\nof activities, making them difficult to expand and evaluate on a\\nlarger scale. Further, no formal review of evidence supporting\\nthe use of WGSS has been conducted to date. In this article, we\\nseek to synthesize existing evidence regarding the impact and\\neffectiveness of WGSS interventions and identify remaining\\nlearning gaps related to this widely endorsed approach.\\nMethod\\nThe research team conducted a systematic literature review\\nfrom August to November 2019 to identify studies evaluating\\nthe effectiveness of WGSS in humanitarian settings. The\\nreview sought to assess the primary outcome of violence expo-\\nsure among women and girls as well as secondary outcomes\\nthat align with the minimum standard objectives outlined\\nabove. The methodology for this exercise was guided by the\\npreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-\\nanalyses standards (Moher et al., 2009). Search terms and\\neligibility criteria were guided by the study’s Population, Inter-\\nvention, Comparison, and Outcomes statement: What is the\\ncurrent evidence available on the impact and effectiveness of\\nWGSS? In order to account for all variations of the search\\nterms, Boolean search terms were used. Peer-reviewed litera-\\nture was identified through a structured search of key biblio-\\ngraphic databases, including SCOPUS, EBSCO, MEDLINE,\\nand CINAHL (see Online Supplemental Annex A), using var-\\nious combinations of women, girls, females, and safe spaces as\\nthe search terms. Records were extracted from databases if the\\ntitle, abstract, or key words included (women OR woman OR\\ngirl* OR female) within 10 words of (“safe space” OR “safe\\nspaces”) OR (WGSS). A gray literature search was also con-\\nducted from relevant organizational websites including the\\nWorld Health Organization, International Rescue Committee\\n(IRC), and UN agencies. Additionally, a hand search of quali-\\nfying articles’ bibliographies was conducted. Finally, emails\\nwere sent to organizations that have implemented safe space\\nprograms in various countries to solicit gray literature related to\\nWGSS evaluations.\\nEligibility Criteria\\nEligibility criteria for study inclusion comprised the following:\\n(i) The record was published in English, (ii) the record stated\\nthe use of a safe space intervention that explicitly focused on\\nactivities meant to achieve at least one of the five objectives\\noutlined in the Minimum Standards (GBV AoR and UNFPA,\\n2019), and (iii) the study was published in 2004 or later (see\\nOnline Supplemental Annex B for complete inclusion/exclu-\\nsion criteria).\\nHumanitarian settings were defined as contexts explicitly\\ndescribed as pertaining to refugees, armed conflict, or natural\\ndisasters, in accordance with the definition of humanitarian\\ncontexts used in other similar studies (Cerna-Turoff et al.,\\n2019; Noble et al., 2019; Rubenstein et al., 2020; Vu et al.,\\n2014). Other terms that were used to refer to WGSS within the\\nrecords included “women-friendly safe spaces” or “women-\\nfriendly spaces”; however, these terms were not included in\\nthe search strategy.\\n2 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)'),\n",

However, only activities\\nwith clearly articulated and measured outcomes were reviewed\\nfor the purposes of this study. Six of the studies’ intervention\\nactivities were further reviewed to determine which of the\\nMinimum Standards objectives were met.

COMPASS Pakistan’s (Asghar et al.,\\n2018) adolescent activities were modified for that particular\\ncontext, integrating livelihoods training alongside the life skills\\ncurriculum so that male guardians and gatekeepers would allow\\ntheir adolescent girls to participate.\\nThe remaining four interventions varied slightly from the\\nCOMPASS model. The Adolescent Girls’ Program pre–post\\nanalysis (IRC, 2013) evaluated the effects of a safe space pro-\\ngram in Ethiopia.

Activities were implemented\\nover an 11-month period at Kyaka and 12 months at Nyaru-\\ngusu. The Kyaka program focused on promoting financial self-\\nreliance among adolescent participants as a way to increase\\ntheir resilience in the face of violence.

As a result,\\nend line data immediately followed the end of the intervention,\\nresulting in an overlap between the reference period for the\\nprimary outcome and the period of intervention delivery and\\npotentially masking reductions in violence attributable to the\\nprogram. While COMPASS Ethiopia sought to evaluate the\\nimpact of the girls and caregiver intervention on girls’ exposure\\nto various forms of violence, COMPASS DRC focused on the\\nadditive effect of the caregiver component, compared to pro-\\ngramming for adolescent girls only.\\nCOMPASS Pakistan, the Adolescent Girls’ Program, the\\nNyarugusu Camp evaluation, and the WGSS program for the\\nRohingya Refugee Response in Bangladesh evaluations uti-\\nlized a single-group pretest–posttest design to compare the\\nchanges in proportion of participants who improved in out-\\ncomes measured. While both COMPASS Pakistan and the\\nAdolescent Girls’ Program sought to evaluate the impact of the\\nintervention on participants’ knowledge of and attitudes toward\\nviolence prevention, reproductive health, financial literacy, and\\nlife skills, only the COMPASS study evaluated these determi-\\nnants’ effects on exposure to violence. Additionally, the Rohin-\\ngya program sought to measure the feasibility and overall\\nsatisfaction of the intervention from the point of view of the\\nwomen and adolescent girl participants and service providers.\\nWhile the evaluation’s research question was not meant to\\nmeasure the impact of the intervention on health and psycho-\\nsocial outcomes, the report did discuss changes in women’s and\\ngirls’ attitudes toward rites of passage and sense of agency/\\nempowerment. Additionally, the evaluation mentioned that the\\ncomplex network of organizations feeding into the safe spaces\\ncompromised the effectiveness of the referral system’s success\\nrate due to inadequate coordination and considerable turnover\\namong service providers. None of these four evaluations\\nincluded a control or comparison group, which presented a\\nlimitation in allowing evaluators to determine the interven-\\ntions’ direct effects on desired outcomes compared to women\\nand girls not enrolled in the programs.\\nThe Kyaka II Settlement evaluation was the only evaluation\\nthat conducted data collection at baseline and midline (specif-\\nically, 11 months after baseline), as opposed to baseline and\\nend line. The Nyarugusu Camp evaluation collected data at\\nbaseline and end line, which occurred 12 months after baseline.\\nBoth interventions sought to evaluate the impact of the inter-\\nvention on livelihood skills and financial assets, access to\\nsocial supports, and perceived sense of safety. In addition to\\na lack of a control or comparison group, this study sustained\\nsignificant loss to follow-up, contributing to smaller sample\\nsizes at midline/end line.\\nEvaluation Results\\nEvaluation results across all seven studies varied. While the\\nCOMPASS Ethiopia evaluation reported no significant effects\\non improvements in adolescents’ psychosocial outcomes and\\nexposure to violence, it did report improvements in attitudes on\\nrites of passage, social support/networks, and child marriage—\\nimportant markers along the articulated theory of change. For\\ninstance, safe space participants exhibited greater odds of\\nbelieving in delaying marriage and child-rearing until after the\\nage of 18 (adjusted odds ratio [aORs] of 1.88 and 2.04, respec-\\ntively). As with Ethiopia, COMPASS DRC reported no signif-\\nicant effects on primary out comes of interest. However,\\ncaregivers’ outcomes improved through decreases in the Par-\\nental Acceptance-Rejection Q uestionnaire subscale scores\\n(Rohner et al., 1978), showing that caregivers exhibited greater\\nwarmth and affection and lower overall rejection compared to\\nthe control group.\\nCOMPASS Pakistan also reported improvements in atti-\\ntudes on rites of passage and social support/networks, with safe\\nspace participants exhibiting greater odds of believing girls can\\nwork outside of the home after marriage and that girls should\\nhave the same opportunities as boys (aORs of 1.39 and 1.43,\\nrespectively). COMPASS Pakistan reported improvements in\\nadolescents’ psychosocial o utcomes, measured using the\\nRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1979) and the Chil-\\ndren’s Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1997), though effect sizes\\nwere minimal. For instance, while the study noted statistically\\nsignificant increases in median self-esteem and hope, both val-\\nues were still within the medium range of positive perception of\\nself-capacity to achieve goals (Bickman et al., 2010).\\nUsing w2 tests, the Adolescent Girls’ Program pre–post eva-\\nluation reported statistically significant improvements in parti-\\ncipants’ psychosocial outcomes, social network-building skills,\\nperceptions of gender norms, and reproductive health knowl-\\nedge. However, while the evaluation reported a statistically\\nsignificant increase in the proportion of participants who knew\\nwhere to receive reproductive health services (from 19% to\\n100%), values of statistical significance and detailed descrip-\\ntion of study methods were not provided within the report,\\npreventing reviewers from being able to discern the validity\\nof the results.\\nThe Kyaka II Settlement, Nyarugusu Camp, and WGSS for\\nthe Rohingya Refugee Response evaluations lacked rigorous\\nevaluation components, including the use of appropriate statis-\\ntical methods. These evaluations did not report any statistical\\nanalysis of the outcomes data measured, limiting the reviewers’\\nabilities to determine the impact of the interventions.

Some\\ncriteria were not reported on in four of the records and are\\ndenoted as such within Table 3.\\nThe quality of the COMPASS studies varied, with Ethiopia\\nmeeting all seven criteria, DRC meeting six, and Pakistan\\nmeeting three.

The Kyaka II Settlement,\\nHagadera, Nyarugusu, and Rohingya Refugee Response\\nreports scored low using this assessment tool as many of the\\ncriteria were not reported on, making it difficult to discern\\nwhether the criteria were or were not met.\\nDiscussion\\nThe present review identified only seven studies evaluating\\nWGSS in humanitarian contexts. This significant gap in the\\nevidence suggests that efforts within the humanitarian sector\\nto address the needs of women and girls through WGSS have\\nnot been based on a quantitative understanding of program\\nimpact or effectiveness. The limited evidence that emerged\\nthrough this review suggests moderate improvements among\\nadolescent girls between the ages of 10 and 19 years old for the\\noutcomes measured. This finding is an important step forward\\nfor a population often overlooked by both the child protection\\nand GBViE sectors due to an intersection of vulnerabilities\\nrelated to their age and gender (Mootz et al., 2019; Stark\\net al., 2020). At the same time, the majority of evaluations did\\nnot include adult women, thus excluding a large proportion of\\nthe target population for WGSS programs, and those who also\\nexperience high levels of violence. Such realities highlight the\\nneed for inclusion of women in evaluations to ensure a robust\\nevidence base for programming that purports to attend to their\\nunique needs (United Nations Office for the Coordination of\\nHumanitarian Affairs [OCHA], 2019).\\nSignificant variation was observed among the studies’ meth-\\nodological dimensions. Given the numerous positive impacts\\nWGSS are intended to confer on women and girls, the range\\nof primary and secondary outcomes observed in the included\\nevaluations was expected. However, the lack of concordance\\nacross studies in how similar outcomes were operationalized for\\ndata collection and analysis made comparisons difficult. Further,\\nwhile four studies omitted vital information concerning the\\nresearch methodologies applie d, these records nonetheless\\nreported positive impacts of their programming. The establish-\\nment and reporting of standardized outcomes and measurement\\nparameters may help to systematically boost the evidence base\\naround WGSS (Ager et al., 2013; Augustinavicius et al., 2018).\\nAn examination of the studies extracted in the original\\nsearch, but deemed ineligible for inclusion in the final review,\\nalso highlights areas for improvement in future implementation\\nand evaluations of WGSS. The majority of records in the gray\\nliterature were excluded because they failed to provide infor-\\nmation beyond program outputs (including access to care,\\nawareness of program, and satisfaction with services). Program\\nimplementers may be able to better conceptualize and define\\nprogram outcomes through the development of a theory of\\nchange specific to a particular WGSS. Given the five related\\nbut distinct objectives of WGSS, as well as the range of activ-\\nities that can be included in programming, it can be difficult to\\ndistill all of these complexities into a one-size-fits-all theory of\\nchange. However, in their recently released guidance document\\nfor WGSS, IRC and the International Medical Corps provide a\\ntheory of change template for organizations to think through\\naccording to the specific goals they hope to achieve and\\nactivities and approaches they plan to employ (Megevand &\\nMarchesini, 2019). The COMP ASS program in Ethiopia\\n(Stark, Asghar, et al., 2018) and multipronged VAWG inter-\\nventions in Rwanda (ActionAid, 2018) and Lebanon (Marsh\\net al., 2016) offer examples of interventions that leveraged\\nprogram-specific theories of change to help organize and\\ndefine how program plans alight with outcomes of interest.\\nExcluded studies also point to a need for greater cross-sector\\ncoordination in defining WGSS, as definitions and components\\nof WGSS were inconsistent acr oss sectors and settings.\\nFurthermore, the limited results included in this review under-\\nscore previously cited concerns about the lack of technical\\nexpertise in GBViE programming on the ground, which further\\ninhibits evaluation capacity (UNICEF Multicountry GBViE\\nProgramme Evaluation: Annexes 3–18, n.d.).\\nThe paucity of evidence may also stem, at least in part, from\\na consistent lack of donor funds being directed to women and\\ngirls’ safety. Indeed, recent analyses show only 0.12% of all\\nhumanitarian funding granted from 2016 to 2018 was directed\\ntoward VAWG programming (Marsh & Blake, n.d.). Such\\nfunding gaps force the sector into the position of having to\\neither withhold services from women and girls to ensure ade-\\nquate funding for research and learning or to implement pro-\\ngramming that is not evidence-based. Having to make such\\ndecisions is both unethical and a disservice to women and girls.\\nIn what may be a more positive sign of progress, four of the\\nstudies identified through this review were published in the past\\n2 years, potentially signaling an emerging interest in equipping\\nresearchers and practitioners with the funding and data needed\\nto better advocate for effective interventions. Similarly, we\\nnote recent large-scale programs such as “What Works to Pre-\\nvent Violence” (n.d.) and the “Global Partnership to End Vio-\\nlence Against Children” (n.d.) , which signal significant\\ninvestments in distilling evidence-based practice.\\nAs researchers and practitioners continue to invest in more\\nrigorous evaluations of WGSS, it will be important to plan for\\nlonger term follow-up in order to assess the impact of program-\\nming over time. While the initial evidence presented in this\\nreview hints at certain positive impacts of WGSS in humani-\\ntarian settings, none of the included studies measured any out-\\ncomes at time points beyond those collected immediately\\nfollowing WGSS participation.

The recent release of the Interagency Min-\\nimum Standards for GBViE programming provides a valuable\\nstarting point for this standardization process—both for pro-\\ngram implementation and for evaluation. While the Minimum\\nStandards focus predominantly on process indicators, they do\\noffer a common definition and a coherent framework for\\nWGSS as a holistic package of services. A complementary tool\\nkit offers further guidance on WGSS implementation, monitor-\\ning, and evaluation—an important step in elucidating how to\\nevaluate WGSS (Megevand & Marchesini, 2019).\\nBoth of these sets of guidance may offer a clearer frame-\\nwork for the way in which WGSS programming is presented\\nand evaluated in the literature moving forward. Importantly,\\nthe evaluations reviewed provided data on select components\\nof WGSS. The humanitarian sector has also seen recent\\nadvances in evaluations of Child Friendly Space (CFS)\\nprogramming—a child protection intervention that uses similar\\ncomponents to those typically contained within the WGSS\\nmodel, although not designed as a VAWG intervention (Ager\\net al., 2013; Hermosilla et al., 2019; Metzler et al., 2019). These\\nCFS evaluations were able to look at the impacts on children\\noffered by a “package of interventions.” A similar approach\\ncould be usefully adapted in tandem with the new Minimum\\nStandards to build a much broader evidence base in support of\\nWGSS.\\nAdditionally, promising evidence from similar interventions\\nin nonemergency settings, including the Empowerment and\\nLivelihood for Adolescents program in Uganda (Bandiera\\net al., 2015) and the Safe and Smart Savings Products for\\nVulnerable Adolescent Girls program in Kenya and Uganda\\n(Austrian & Muthengi, 2013), has shown these programs can\\nreduce the incidence of violence among girl participants. Simi-\\nlarly, a systematic review from Marcus and colleagues (2017)\\noutlines evidence from numerous “girls’ club” interventions\\nand life skills programs across the globe, demonstrating these\\ninterventions’ positive impacts on girls’ psychosocial well-\\nbeing (Marcus et al., 2017). Interventions that included educa-\\ntional components and financial literacy were seen to extend\\nthe beneficial impacts of “safe space” programming among\\nadolescent girls, components that carry equal relevance and\\nimportance for girls in emergency settings. Incorporating les-\\nsons learned from evaluations of comparable interventions in\\nnonemergency settings may further improve WGSS program-\\nming and effectiveness in emergencies.\\nThis review is not without limitations. Inclusion criteria for\\nthis review required that included studies involve a formal\\nquantitative evaluation of a WGSS intervention. Future\\nreviews might consider assessing evidence derived from qua-\\nlitative and participatory assessments, which can provide fur-\\nther insights on WGSS’ effectiveness. Furthermore, many\\norganizations that implement WGSS may not have the\\nresources needed to design and conduct rigorous evaluations\\nof their programs, potentially overlooking valuable contribu-\\ntions to the already limited evidence base.\\nConclusion\\nReflecting the international community’s growing prioritiza-\\ntion of keeping women and girls safe, the fifth sustainable\\ndevelopment goal calls for the elimination of violence against\\nall women and girls by 2030 (Interagency and Expert Group on\\nTable 3.Quality Assessment Criteria for Studies Included in Analysis.\\nCriteria\\nStark,\\nAsghar, et al.\\n(2018)\\nStark,\\nSeff, et al.\\n(2018)\\nAsghar,\\net al.\\n(2018)\\nDanish Refugee\\nCouncil\\n(2014)\\nInternational\\nRescue Committee\\n(IRC; 2013)\\nSeema & Rahman\\n(2019) IRC (2014)\\nUse of counterfactual/\\ncomparison group\\nXX\\nAdequate sample size X X X\\nAdequate response rate\\n(reported and >80%)\\nX X reported\\nUse of an established\\ninstrument for measuring\\nassociation with violence\\nX X Not reported Not reported Not reported Not reported\\nClearly stated definitions for\\npredictors\\nXX X\\nStudy design accounts for\\ntemporality between\\npredictors and outcomes\\nXX X X X X X\\nAnalysis controls for\\nconfounding/effect\\nmodifying variables\\nXX X\\nTotal 7/7 7/7 4/7 1/7 1/7 1/7 1/7\\nNote.

Policy makers should prioritize funding\\nfor effective WGSS program implementation and eva-\\nluation of near- and long-term outcomes without com-\\npromising service delivery to women and girls.\\nResearch.\\n/C15 There is a need for more rigorous evaluation of WGSS\\nas a holistic “package of interventions” that incorporates\\nand tests the newly defined Interagency Minimum Stan-\\ndards for GBViE Settings Programming.\\n/C15 Longitudinal studies with substantial follow-up are\\nneeded to better determine long-term effects of WGSS\\nprogramming on individual- and community-level\\noutcomes.\\n/C15 While not losing focus on the impact of safe space pro-\\ngramming for girls, there is a critical need to bolster\\nevaluations targeting adult women as well.\\nAuthors’ Note\\nThe funders played no role in the study design, data analysis, report\\nwriting, or decision to submit this article for publication.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors wish to acknowledge Susan Fowler for her contributions\\nto this research.\\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\\nFunding\\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\\nproject was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Develop-\\nment Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (Award Number:\\n720FDA19GR00221).\\nORCID iDs\\nLindsay Stark https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8775-9735\\nIlana Seff https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2569-995X\\nAlli Gillespie https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1632-3272\\nSupplemental Material\\nSupplemental material for this article is available online.\\nReferences\\nAas, S.

This gadget comprises of a framework that \\nguarantees double cautions if she thinks she is in a difficult \\nsituation. This framework can be turned on by a lady on the off \\nchance that she even figures she would be in a difficult \\nsituation. In a panic alarming framework, if the lady is hit on \\nthe head from behind, she may never find an opportunity to \\npress the emergency signal and nobody will realize she is in a \\ndifficult situation. Our framework tackles this issue. This \\ngadget is to be turned on ahead of time by a lady in the event \\nthat she is strolling on a forlorn street or some dull rear \\nentryway or any far off territory. Just the lady validated to the \\ngadgets can begin the framework by finger impression check. \\nWhen begun the gadgets requires the lady to continually check \\nher finger on the framework like clockwork, else the \\nframework presently sends her area to the approved number \\nthrough SMS. In this case regardless of whether somebody hits \\nthe lady or the lady tumbles down and get oblivious, she \\ndoesn\\'t have to do anything, the framework consequently sends \\nmessage when the fingerprint is missed. The gadget utilizes \\nGPS sensor alongside a GS, modem, LCD display, LoRa and \\nmicrocontroller based circuit to accomplish this framework.  \\nKeywords— LoRa, GPS, GSM, Arduino \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nProtection is a state of protection from danger and harm. \\nIn a general sense, security is closer to a concept like \\nsecurity. Another emphasis is on protecting the nuances \\nbetween the two from outward danger. Anyone or act that \\nbreaks into the condition of safety is liable for a security \\nbreach. In most cases, \"security\" is inseparable from \\n\"goodness\", but the special word \"security\" indicates that \\nsomething is not yet particularly secures, designed with \\nATmega328 for this project. This device provides women\\'s \\nsecurity Systems using GPS, GSM, LORA. Devices include \\nGPS receivers, microprocessors, and GSM modems. GPS \\nreceivers must be placed from satellites within latitude and \\nlongitude to receive information. The microcomputer \\nmeasures the data and sends this controlled data. The GSM \\nmodem interferes with the MCU for clients using the GSM \\nmodem. GSM modems send SMS to predefined versatile \\nnumbers. If a woman is at risk and needs self-defense, \\npowering on the device will immediately activate the entire \\nsystem and send location information via GSM and GPS via \\nLoRa. An SMS will be sent to that person. This system gets \\nan Arduino Mega (ATmega2560) Control system that \\nfunctions as the brain of the system because all program \\ninstructions are stored in the system. Here is a fingerprint \\nsensor to know about the authentication of authorized people. \\nIf a woman has any emergency every 5 minutes, the \\nfingerprint sensor will require a beating print of the \\nauthorized person and a warning message will be sent to the \\nparties concerned. All data transferred via LORA and \\nmonitored in the LORA receiver section. \\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY \\nBhuvaneshwari Mehtre [1] proposed “A Raspberry Pi-\\nbased Safety System for Women Security using IOT”. In this \\nsystem, they are using three ways of connecting to the \\nconcerned authorities. S. Bhuvaneswari, Akhila Krishna.D, \\nAnnapoorna. M, Gayathri. G [2] proposed that, Defense at \\nTouch – A Sensor Based Hand-Held Device for Women \\nSafety. The system provides a mechanism for the woman to \\nrespond immediately when she is in danger. Juhitha et al [3] \\ndesigned and implemented the Women Safety System Using \\nMobile Application in Real-Time Environment. They are \\ncreating mobile application. This application requires an \\nunderlying enrollment alongside Emergency contacts. \\nSanjana Babdi et al [4] proposed that, “Women’s Safety \\nUsing IOT”. This system describes Arduino Nano and a safe \\nand secure electronic system for women, including sensors \\nsuch as pulse rate sensors, accelerometers and temperature \\nsensors. The project also uses buzzers, GSM and GPS. \\nSathyasri et al [5] implemented, “Design and Implementation \\nof Women Safety System Based on IOT Technology”. This \\nsystem uses a microcontroller (ATmega2560), a buzzer, a \\nnerve simulator, a vibration sensor, a GPS module (Neo-\\n6M), an IOT module (ESP-12E), a trigger and GSM module \\n(SIM900). This system requires the device to remain \\ntriggered when a woman feels dangerous. Preethu Daniel et \\nal [6] proposed that, “Smart Band for Women Safety”. In this \\nsystem, they are using GSM, URL, Arduino, SIM800L. In \\nthis project, they have made an attempt to develop a smart \\ndevice that can assist women when they feel unsecure. This \\ndevice is a wearable band that women can wear. Dudyala \\nSunitha et al [7] tells that, “Design and Implementation of \\nWomen Safety System Based on IOT Technologies”. In this \\nsystem, they are using Mobile application, GPS Arduino, \\nMATLAB based buzzer, camera and button to activate the \\nservices. This gadget is incredibly versatile and can be \\ninitiated by the casualty on being attacked just by the snap of \\na catch that will bring her present area and also capture the \\nimage of the attacker via MATLAB based camera.

The proposed work aims at \\nd\\nesigning IOT based safety device that relies on providing \\nsecurity to women by fingerprint-based method of \\nconnectivity to the device and alerting nearby people and \\npolice when a women is not safe. Manasa et al [9] says \\n“Smart Security Device for Women Safety”. This project \\nuses GSM and GPS modems. The system is interconnected \\nwith an alarm system to alert police stations and relatives. \\nThis detection and messaging system consists of Arduino \\nboard, a GSM modem and a GPS receiver. Jismi Thomas et \\nal [10] proposed that “Touch Me Not-A Women Safety \\nDevice”. In this system, they are using Arduino \\nprogramming, GSM module, GPS   Module, SD Module.  In \\nthis device, Button can be attached to the cloth. Imtiaz Hanif \\net al [11] tell that, “An IOT based Device for Women’s Self-\\nSecurity System to Avoid Unlawful Activities”. In this \\narticle [12], we have developed an IoT-based embedded \\ndevice that can communicate with on-demand emergency \\ncalls. \\nIII. EXISTING METHOD \\nThe mobile apps contain all the important functions such \\nas GPS tracking, emergency contact numbers, instructions on \\nsafe places, etc. The app also corrects the safe areas and their \\nsafety values that are available at the time of a problem. It \\nalso allows users to identify unsafe areas and help others. A \\npanic button sends a radio signal when pressed and alerts you \\nin an emergency. Wearable devices are used to keep track of \\ninformation in real time. They have motion sensors that take \\nthe snapshot and synchronize it with mobile devices. The \\nbell system is also used in an emergency and alerts the \\nauthorized person. \\nIV. PROPOSED SYSTEM \\nIn this framework, we use ARDUINO which goes \\nabout as mind of the framework, on the grounds that the \\nwhole framework program is guidance put away in it. Here \\nwe have fingerprint sensor to know about authentication of \\nthe authorized person. If women have some emergency \\nsituation every five minutes fingerprint sensor needs thump \\nprint of the authorized person and alert message will send to \\nthe concern person. All the data is transferred through LORA \\nand monitored at LORA receiver section. The block diagram \\nof the transmitter is shown in figure 1 and the monitoring \\nsystem shown in figure 2. \\nFig. 1. Block diagram of the Transmitter \\nFig. 2. Monitoring Section \\nList of Modules:  \\nThe lists of modules required for the device are, \\na. Arduino Uno  \\nb. GPS \\nc. LCD DISPLAY  \\nd. GSM \\ne. Fingerprint Sensor \\nf. LoRa \\nA. Arduino Uno: \\nArduino Uno is a microcontroller board that \\nsupports ATmega328P. It has 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz \\ncrystal oscillator, a USB port,14 digital input/output pins, \\npunch sockets, connections, ICSP connectors and push \\nbuttons, including everything who wants to help a \\nmicrocontroller; just Connect it to PC via USB connection, \\nor force it to start with an DC/AC connection or battery. \\nB. GPS: \\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) can be a satellite \\nnavigation system that provides the user with the overall \\nlocation and time information of weather conditions. GPS \\nsatellites orbit the earth exactly twice a day. Each satellite \\ntransmits specific signals and specific orbiting boundaries so \\nthat GPS devices can interpret and process the exact area of \\nthe satellite. The GPS device uses this data and conversations \\nto find the customer’s area of attention. Basically, a GPS \\nreceiver estimates the position of each satellite based on how \\nlong it takes to receive a communication signal. By \\nmeasuring the distance over satellites, the receiver can \\ndetermine the user's location and display it electronically. \\nStay on the road, pull a golf course, live at home, or explore \\nall.  \\nC. LCD Display: \\nThe 16x2 LCD means it can show 16 characters per \\nline so there are 2 lines. Each character of this LCD is \\ndisplayed on a 5x7 pixel screen. This LCD has 2 registers, in \\nparticular, data and command. The command record stores \\nits instructions provided on the LCD. The command is a \\nguide provided by the LCD to perform pre-specified tasks \\nsuch as starting it, display control, setting the directional \\nposition, display control, clearing its screen as well as the \\ndata log stores the information displayed on the LCD screen. \\nThe data is ASCII evaluation of the features displayed on the \\nLCD. \\nD. GSM: \\nLimited and networks integration in detail \\nexplained aesthetics GSM, but the devices do not cause the \\nhardware. It should be restricted to one senses only the least \\nunderstandable once, so log make operational managers to \\nbuy equipment from various service providers. GSM \\nnetworks are divided into three main modes: interconnection \\nstructure (SS), base structure (BSS), and performance and \\nemotional support network (OSS). The GSM model is used \\nto build documents between the PC and the GSM-G/PRS \\nmodel. (GSM)  Global Mobile Communication System SIM \\nCard is inserted inside the mobile phone to send and receive \\nGPRS messages to the victim.

With the expansion of GSM usage, the benefit class \\ns\\ncale has produced a much broader discourse that includes \\nsome of the most common applications, machine tools, and \\nmachine-to-machine exchanges. It operates at a frequency of \\n900MHz -1800MHz. \\nE. Sensor: \\nThe R305 fingerprint module includes a unique visual \\neffects sensor, high-speed DSP processor, fingerprint scanner \\noptimization, advanced FLASH and other tools and \\nprogramming and programming, stable execution, vertical \\nmode, fingerprint viewing, image preparation, fingerprint \\nviewer, search and save storage and other work. \\nFingerprinting involves two components: the fingerprint \\nimage object and the fingerprint coordinator (the coordinator \\ncan be 1: 1 or 1: N). When writing, the client needs to \\nfingerprint several times. The technique will capture two \\nimages of the cross finger, depending on the result prepared \\nand the format storage. \\n \\nF\\n. LoRa: \\nLORA (Long Range) is a balanced strategy for a large \\nnetwork with low power consumption. This is due to the \\ndiffusion classification methods derived from CSS. Lora uses \\nunlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands such as 433 MHz, 865 \\nto 867 MHz (India), 868MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (Australia \\nand North America), and 923 MHz (Asia) Consume less \\nelectricity. The technology covers the body but other \\ntechnologies and protocols like the LoRa WAN cover upper \\nlayer. Depending on the spreading factor, data rates between \\n0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s can be achieved. The LoRa device \\nuses geographic functions to subdivide device locations \\nthrough door-to-door clocks. \\nV\\n. RESULTAND DISCUSSION \\nFig. 3.

Sentinel app is created for this very  purpose. Within just a \\nclick of a button everyone in the surrounding is alerted and real -time location will be sent along with \\na map of live tracking movements. \\nAccording to the Annual National Crime Record Bureau’s (NCRB) Crimes against Women \\n(2019) dataset released on 29th September 2020. The dataset is altered to get the total crimes that was \\nagainst women on the mentioned year , it is clear that, there were a total of 4,67,882 crime  cases \\nagainst women registered in India and there were averagely 16133.86 crimes were happening against \\nwomen. The crime rate shows an increase of 7.3% from the predecessor year(2018 – 3,78,236 cases). \\nThe registered crime per lakh women population is 62.4 in 2019 whereas in 2018 it was 58.8. \\nBy using Sentinel Application, ma jority of the cases can be averted , since 47.6% of the ca ses \\nare filed on assault, rape, kidnapping and abduction of women. \\n \\n2.

So even if the victim decides  to send an SOS Alert to the pre – \\nregistered cont acts, it will be too late for them to reach the scene on time which decreases the \\nprobability of surviving for the victim. As for every 1 minute delay, the probability decreases by 1%. \\nThe second test case is that when the victim has the sentinel app and s tarts an alert, the people’s \\nresponse time would be way faster than the other ways.

The rest of the apps \\nare at below 80% since the lo cation are sent as a SMS message. The guardian has to re open the new \\nmessages with location update again and again to get the location of the victim which takes up the \\ntime and also it is the same case for isafe app but the messages are sent with a google maps link \\nwhich will make the response time lesser when compared with other apps excluding sentinel. \\n \\nFig. 15 - Visualization of Table.1 in Terms of Survival Rate and Response Time for each Application \\n \\n \\nFrom Fig.15, it is clear that the sentinel app can resp ond in 10 mins as for other apps it takes \\nabout at least a minimum of 25 – 30 mins to respond in action. \\nThe Sentinel application has the highest survival rate in accordance with response time. \\n \\n6.

The primary issue in the  \\nhandling of these cases by the police lies in constraints  preventing them from responding quickly to calls of distre ss. These \\nconstraints include not knowing the location of the crime, and not knowing the crime is occurring at all at the victim’s end, \\nreaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a challen ge.To avoid these situations, this paper introduces a mobile  application \\ncalled ”Spark Women” that provides women with a reliable way to  place an emergency call, Message and location update to the \\npolice and also to the close relatives of her family.The user can easily press the PANIC button on the screen of the app so that the \\nrespective people can receive all alerts. This paper describ es the application, its development, and its technical \\nimplementation. [1] \\nIndex Terms: Component, formatting, style, styling, insert  \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nAs most of the reports compiled by the World Health Organi zation stated that that most of the women around the w orld have been \\nvictims of sexual violence[1. The National Crime Records Bureau of India reported that a woman is assaulted in the  country every \\nthree minutes. The police are not able to help, as inf ormation about the crime does not reach them in time.  With the number of \\ncriminal acts towards women increasing day by day so it  is evident that a solution is required from the technica l community to \\ntackle the situation. Presently mobile application advance ment assumes a signif- icant part with working frameworks like Windows, \\nAndroid, and IOS etc. Spark Women App might be a way to prov ide women safety by enabling them to place an emergency  call to \\nthe police in a quick, discreet way. The use of the appli cation is divided into three steps: input of emergency co ntacts, triggering of \\nthe alarm, and transmission of an emergency message and c all to the local police. The message contains the user ’s current \\ngeographical location, and a statement that “I Am In Tro uble”. This portable application is fundamentally utilized for women’s well \\nbeing. It can be utilized to discover and help women’s in crisis circumstance. It demonstrates the correct area where the individual is \\nfound and send the point of Women Safety Device With G PS Tracking System Using Arduino, 2022 interest through Short \\nMessage Service (SMS) to her relatives, guardian and frie nds. Spark Women app will inform and update your dear ones if you are \\nstuck in an unsafe place.It will send all the details related to your location with just a tap of a button. The ap p will send an SMS to a \\npre-configured number along with your location and a link of  Google Maps.This app also has a section of self defence w here \\nwomen can learn different techniques so that they will be prepared for protecting themselves in a way. It also h as a section of some \\nbasic laws to make a women aware about her rights.It’s a very simple app to use and is important too.This clear-c ut sequence of \\nevents ensures that help can be provided to women in cr ises as quickly as possible. Our application ensures that ques tions \\nregarding the user’s location or whom to contact, as well  as confusion at police stations regarding where the off icers must be \\ndispatched from, do not arise. [5] \\nII. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND SOLUTION DESCRIPTION \\nA. Motivation \\nEvery day, women are assaulted, molested and violated on the streets of their own cities. Violence against women happens all over \\nthe world, particularly in developing countries. This violence can take many forms: physical, sexual, or psycholog- ical. [6] \\nPhysical assault on women involves the use of force to  injure or endanger them. Forms of sexual assault include rape , human \\ntrafficking and forced sexual exploitation, genital mutilation,  child marriage and intimate partner violence. Psy- chologica l abuse \\nresults in psychological trauma, which could manifest as  chronic depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress dis order. The above \\nall have severe consequences on a woman’s physical and m ental well-being. \\n \\nB. Problem Statement and Solution \\nThe aim of this project, is to effectively build an app for woman empowerment in our society. We tried to achieve  this by making \\na mobile application that: 1) Has a simple and straight forward user interface 2) Ensures that call alert is s ent to the police \\nand message alerts to both police and close friends. 3) Al lows user to send location as well. 4) Allows users to  learn about the \\nbasic laws and self techniques to protect themselves. The reason behind creating a mobile application to ac hieve the problem \\nstatement was due to the fact that a mobile phone is normally carried by everyone and is always along with an y person.

APP DEVELOPMENT AND WORKING \\nThe application has been divided into two components: a front end user interface and a back-end functional unit. The user interface \\nwas developed using JavaScript, with native platform c ode in Java waiting for the user to engage the alert mec hanism. The back-\\nend was implemented using JavaScript, alongside firebase database. Below is the Flow Diagram of our Spark Women App : [9] \\nFig. 1. Flow Diagram of App \\n \\nA. App’s Interface Design \\nThe user interface of the application is designed by keeping in mind that it should be simpler to use. The use of the application is \\nintended to be straightforward, as it would be accessed prim arily in times of crisis, apart from the adding of emerge ncy contacts. \\nThe starting interface of the app is the Get Started Page  in which there is a button named Get started which will  be clicked by the \\nuser and next will be the home screen of the app. [2] \\nThe home page of the application has following sections: Fir stly, contacts icon is there in which user can add th e emergency \\ncontacts so that those contacts can get the alerts. Then there are other icons like Self Defence, Settings and Basic laws.The main one \\nis PANIC Button which is used for all alerts to be sent to  respective contacts. [7] \\n \\nB. Adding Emergency Contacts \\nWhen the user opens the application for the first time,  she is asked to enter her emergency contacts so the same can be stored. \\nThe emergency contacts can be entered by adding name and pho ne number. Thereafter, the application will run as a b ackground \\nservice which can be triggered in case of an emergency. [10] \\n \\nFig. 2. Starting Interface of Spark Women App'),\n",

Hence, a smart phone can be used efficiently for personal safety or various oth er protection purposes \\nespecially f or women. This app can be activated by a single click when the user feels she is in danger. This app lication \\ncommuniqués the user’s location to the registered contacts for every few seconds in the form of mess age. Thus, it acts like a  \\nsentinel following be hind the person till the user feels she is safe. This paper presents analysis a unique feature of th is \\napplication to send the message to the registered contacts continuously till they are pressing ‘HELP ’ button. Continuous \\nlocation tracking information via SMS helps to find the location of the victim quickly and can be rescued safely. This application \\naims to ensure women safety. This is achieved by addressing the circumstances that compromise the sa fety of women in today’s \\nday and age. This app ensures women are not put into such situations through various features offered by our system. \\nKeywords: Smart Phone, Android, Registered Contacts, GPS location, database, URL. \\n \\nI.      INDRODUCTION \\nIn today’s world, it is not safe for a person to travel alone at night especially for women; it will be high time to travel alone because \\na woman is not highly strong as men to protect herself from them. The good way to reduce chances in becoming a victim of violent \\ncrime (robbery, sexual assault, rape, domestic violence) is to identify and call on resources to help you out of  unsafe situations. \\nWhether you are in instant trouble or got separated from friends during night apps on your phone can diminish our risk and bring \\nassistance when we require it. In this paper, we presen t Security Alert an application for smart phones working over android \\nplatform. National Crime Records Bureau of India, reported incidents of crime against women increase d 6.4% during 2012, and a  \\ncrime against a woman is committed every three minutes. 65% of Indian men believe women should tolerate violence in order to \\nkeep the family together, and women sometimes deserve to be beaten. In January 2011, the Internation al Men and Gender Equality \\nSurvey (IMAGES) Questionnaire reported and do not know to reach home, having these that 24% of Indian men had committed \\nsexual violence at some point during their lives. Our motto in developing this app is to provide a s afe environment to women \\nthrough smart phone as today most of the people are carrying smart phones to wherever they go. Of course, the Delhi Nirbhaya case \\nhas made the Government to make the laws tougher, but even though the sexual crime rate in India hav e not decreased. So, it i s \\nbetter to take our own safety measures rather than becoming a victim of those crimes. This paper is organised as follows. Section– II \\ndescribes the literature survey of the existing apps and the related work of creating the applicatio n. Section – III presents the \\nproposed work and key features of the application. Consequently, t he implementation of the application is described in the section \\nIV. The section – V presents the testing results of the application after installing in the smart phone. \\nFinally, section –VI concludes the paper and presents the future work for the paper ex plained in the Section – V and the work \\npresents the final conclusion in the Section – VI. \\n \\nII.      LITERATURE SURVEY \\nAs a part of literature survey, we investigated some applications of women safety that already exist in market. The aim is to observe \\nhow these applications work and to see how they can be improved and how are they different. To date it is iden tified that the \\nfollowing Android Apps of women security are good and are offering relatively similar service. \\n1) Women’s Security: This app is developed by App Soft India. The key features of the app are: the user has to save some details. \\nThese details include: Email address and password of the user, Email address and mobile number of th e recipient and a text \\nmessage. Then, app is loaded as a “widget”, so that when the user touches the app, it alerts the recipient. Another key feature of \\napp is that it records the voice of surroundings for about 45 seconds and this recorded voice, text message containing location \\ncoordinates of the user is sent to the recipient mobile number. [4] ` \\n2) Police Nearby: This app is developed by Big Systems in 2013.The police nearby scanner android app is built with the  aim to \\nconnect citizens & students to their nearest police stations city wise at one click and will permit the community to become more \\ninvolved right from your Android Smart phones.'),\n",

EXISTING SYSTEM \\nIn Previous application login and logout pages are provided which will time consuming at the time of  emergency. These \\napplications are critical or difficult to understand their user interface. In previous app there is no such function provide for call. In \\nthis app there is no facility provide it to find nearby hospitals, police stations in emergency situation. \\nThe Problems with Existing System \\n1) The Drawbacks of the existing system is when emergency situation occurs the user cannot set the alert function. \\n2) You cannot send message if there is no balance in your mobile. \\n3) If there is no internet connection in message receiver phone then he could not search  the location of that person who will be in \\ntrouble. \\n4) It does not send voice recording and does not takes any photographs video during the panic situation. \\n \\nV.      PROPOSED SYSTEM \\nIn this proposed system, the user writes the message content and also selects the c ontacts to which the message has to be sent and \\nsave it. So, when he is in some danger by just opening the app and pressing the HELP button, the mes sage stored will be sent to \\nthose numbers he has added in this application. So that he can \\nreceive the help in correct time. \\nADVANTAGES \\n1) Your loved ones and close friends can automatically receive text message. \\n2) Exact time of the alert triggered. Your location (with map link). \\n3) The battery level of your phone. \\n4) It monitors the frequent no of shakes in a particular locality or area and marks that particular location as DANGERZONE. \\n5) Automatic prompt for activating location. \\n6) Self-defence video for guiding victim, how to remain safe and protect in dangerous situations arising. \\n \\nVI.      MODULE DESCRIPTION \\n1) Module 1: Creating Homepage Components \\nThe initial process of the application starts with creating a home page. The home page consists of options like, \\na) Contact: It is used to enter the contacts for the purpose of emergency call and SMS service. \\nb) SMS alert: It has the functionalities like start or stop the service. \\nc) Basic laws: It is a page which displays several act related to women safety along with a description to know. \\nd) Self defence: It is a page which displays a video content related to self defence. \\ne) Panic button: It is an emergency button to press when the user feels she is in trouble'),\n",

It also displays some emergency numbers in case of \\nemergency to contact. The user can add multiple contacts for the SMS alert. For the call alert, the  realization of freedom. So, we are \\ntrying to The user can add new contact or the user can delete an existing contact. \\n \\n3) Module 3: Sms Alert And Location Sharing Service \\nThis is the main functionality of the project. When the user feels that she is in trouble, then the user can click the panic button in the \\napp which will alert the contacts with the SMS along with the user’s location, or if the user feels that she has no time to open the app \\nand alert, then she can just shake her phones multiple times which will automatically invoke the service and sends the alert message \\nto the predefined contacts along with location. When the user feels safe, she can stop the service also through the stop service option \\nwhich will eliminate the unnecessary exception messages. \\n \\nVII.      BLOCK DIAGRAM \\n \\n \\nVIII.      CONCLUSION \\nUnfortunately, the safety of women is in doubt and security is not concerned. Many headlines still c oming across against wome n \\nindicates that increasing trends of such sexual assault, rapes still happening in today’s generation. Around 80 percent of women are \\nlosing confidence and have fear towards the contribute little efforts towards women which user can add any one of the numbers. \\nWhenever the user can modify the data or contacts if needed. will ensure the safety and respect for women so that she can also have \\nrights to grow equally like men. This mobile application is very much helpful for anyone. This application will help user to send the \\nSMS and Current location through GPS. The current address will be fetched and send it to any contact  depending on user. Here the \\nuser can take precautions before coming to the actual danger. \\n \\nIX.      FUTURE SCOPE \\nAs the technology emerges, it is possible to upgrade the system and can be adaptable to desired environment. Because it is based on \\nobject-oriented design, any furthe r changes can be easily adapted. For future upgrades we will be linking our application with the \\ndatabases of driver’s details, i.e. if the driver is committing any sort of crime and he or she has gone missing so we would be able to \\ntrace him by the inform ation provided in the databases. We will be updating this feature in our app so that app can save dr iver’s \\ndetail which will contain information like photo, address of driver, contact details, batch assigned  by the RTO and the certi fication \\nof vehicle details as well. We will try to add more useful modules in this app so it will more adaptive. \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] C.Yi and Y.Tian Text string detection from natural scenes by structure -based partition and grouping IEEE Conf.

The crime rates in case of women have risen to a \\ngreat extent. In order to reduce this crime rate and ensure women \\nsafety a secure Mobile application is proposed. This application \\nrequires an initial registration along with Emergency contacts. \\nWhen the user is travelling from one place to another, the dynamic \\nGPS tracking offered by G-Maps API is turned on to view the \\nuser’s location on a map. During an emergency situation, the \\nvictim can either shake the mobile phone to a specific frequency or \\nlong press lower volume button. Immediately after this action an \\nalert message containing the name of the victim, GPS location and \\na help message is sent via SMS to all the registered Emergency \\nContacts and a Call is made to the Master contact. Suppose if the \\nemergency contact person has the same application they can \\ndirectly monitor through the dynamic GPS tracking system, \\notherwise they can access the location through the message link. \\nThe Person can immediately rush to the spot to help the victim. \\nSuppose if the victim is in motion, the live location will be updated \\nfor every certain seconds. Not only during Emergency situations, \\neven when the battery drains out, an alert message with the last \\nupdated location is sent to the Emergency Contacts. \\n \\nKeywords: G-Maps API, Alert message, Emergency Contacts, \\nSMS, GPS tracking system, Mobile application, Android, Master \\ncontact, Sensor. \\n1. Introduction \\nToday’s smartphones or mobile phones function the central \\ncomputing and communication device in people’s lives. These \\nphones engraft varied sensors, together with measuring device, \\ndigital compass, GPS, and camera, e nabling new applications \\nin varied domains like health care, social networks, and \\nenvironmental observation. \\nThis can be as a result of falls square measure a significant \\nhealth risk for older folks, decreasing the standard of life or \\nperhaps leading to death. The autumn detection system will be \\nwill be four categories: image -based systems, database -based \\napproach, context -aware techniques and acceleration -based \\ndetection. for instance, the advantage of image-based associated \\ncontext-aware approaches is a correct detection rate; the \\ninformation-based approach stores numerous detected user \\nbehavior into a database for numerous activities.  The  \\n \\nacceleration-based detection is that the most generally used \\ntechnique, as current high -level devices integrate the \\nacceleration sensors. \\nThe planned system has 3 central components: sensing, \\nlearning, and alerting. within the within the, we have a tendency \\nto take the benefits of the information  base-based approach to \\ngather realistic fall data. That is, we have a tendency to collect \\nthe important measuring device information from the mobile \\nembedded sensors and record the corresponding user behavior \\nto work out the specified parameters. within the second \\nelement, the planned system learns the link between the autumn \\nbehavior and also the collected information. within the third \\nelement, the mobile phones alert pre - conﬁgured emergency \\ncontacts through message. The experiment any investigates the \\nimpact of various locations wherever the phone hooked up, \\ntogether with ches t, waist, and thigh. Finally, we have a \\ntendency to conduct in depth experiments to gauge the \\nadditional power consumption ensuing from the autumn \\ndetection software package. \\n2. Literature survey \\nC. Wang says, falls are the number one cause of injuries in \\nthe elderly. A wearable fall detector can automatically detect \\nthe occurrence of a fall and alert a caregiver or a medical rescue \\ngroup for immediate assistance, mitigating fall-related injuries. \\nHowever, most studies on fall detection to date have focused on \\nthe accuracy of detection while neglecting power efficiency and \\nbattery life, and hence the developed fall detectors usually \\ncannot operate for a long period (a year or more) without \\nrecharging or replacing their batteries. This fall detector reduces \\nits power consumption through both hardware - and firmware-\\nbased approaches. This study also incorporates several human \\ntrials to develop and evaluate the device, including simulated \\nfalls and activities of daily living. The LPFD reduces its power \\nconsumption using both hardware and firmware based \\napproaches. The parameters of the classifier were optimized to \\nachieve high but balanced sensitivity and specificity using PSO \\nin the training stage.

These experiments show that the fall \\ndetector achieves high sensitivity (97.5% and 93.0%) and \\nspecificity (93.2% and 87.3%) on training and testing datasets, \\nwhilst providing an estimated battery  life of 664.9 days.  The \\nmain drawback is that the LPFD is designed to work in an \\nindoor home environment [2]. \\nF. Sposaro says, injuries due to falls are among the leading \\ncauses of hospitalization in elderly persons, often leading to a \\nrapid decline in  quality of life or death. Rapid response can \\nimprove the patient’s outcome, but this is often often lacking \\nwhen the injured person lives alone and therefore the nature of \\nthe injury complicates calling for help. This paper presents an \\nalert system for fal l detection using common commercially \\navailable electronic devices to both detect the autumn and alert \\nauthorities. It is proven that fall detection algorithm makes the \\nsystem highly reliable. It is Reliable and reduce the number of \\nfalse positives mean g reater adoption by emergency services. \\nAn Android-based smart phone is used with an integrated tri -\\naxial accelerometer. Data from the accelerometer is evaluated \\nwith several thresholds based algorithms and position data to \\nfigure out a fall. The threshold i s adaptive supported user \\nprovided parameters such as: height, weight, and level of \\nactivity. The algorithm modify to unique movements that a \\nphone experiences as against similar systems that require users \\nto mount accelerometers to their chest or trunk. If a fall is sense, \\nthen a notification is raised for the user’s response. If the user \\ndoesn\\'t respond, the system alerts pre-specified social contacts \\nwith an informational message via SMS. If a contact responds \\nthe system commits an audible notification, a utomatically \\nconnects, and enables the speakerphone.  Certain interactions \\nsuch as violently answering then ending a call or dropping the \\nphone can break the Thresholds can change positions. If a \\ncontact confirms a fall, an emergency service will be alerted.  \\nOur system provides a realizable, cost effective solution to fall \\ndetection employing a simple graphical interface while not \\noverwhelming the user with uncomfortable sensors [4]. \\nN.

To handle the on top of drawback we \\nhave a tendency to propose to develop Associate in Nursing \\nacoustic fall detection system(FADE); which will mechanically \\nsignal a fall to the observance caregiver. As against several \\nexistent fall detection systems that require the monitored person \\nto wear devices like accelerometers or gyroscopes within the \\nleast times, our system is completely unnoticeable  by not \\nrequiring any wearable devices. to scale back the warning rate, \\nwe have a tendency to use Associate in Nursing array of \\nacoustic sensors to urge sound supply height data. The sound is \\ntaken under consideration a warning if it comes from a supply \\nset at a height on top of two feet. victimisation the peak of the \\nsound, has drastically improved the warning rate. This \\ndedicated fall detection system relies on a linear array of audio \\nsensors. We tested our system during a pilot study that consisted \\nof a collection of twenty-three falls performed by a stunt actor \\nthroughout six sessions of regarding unit of time every (1.3 \\nhours in total). The actor was antecedently trained by our \\nnursing collaborators to fall like Associate in Nursing old \\nperson. the employ ment of height data reduced the warning \\nhourly rate from thirty-two to five at a 100% fall detection rate. \\nThough the warning rate has been reduced, it\\'s not fully \\ncorrected, Different array shapes(circular) are often thought -\\nabout for additional reduction of warning rate [5].  \\nJ.

With the elderly \\npopulation surging, especially with aging \"baby boomers\", fall \\ndetection becomes increase. However, existing commerci al \\nproducts and academic solutions struggle to realize pervasive \\nfall detection.  we propose utilizing mobile phones as a platform \\nfor pervasive fall detection system development. To our \\nknowledge, we are the first to do so. We design a detection \\nalgorithm supported mobile platforms.

INTRODUCTION \\nIn this twentieth -century where everyone is allowed to do \\nwhatever they want and to roam wherever they wish to go. \\nThere is a section or say half the section of the society who are \\nstill constrained to live their lives to the fullest. Yes, we are \\ntalking about females. Women are still suffering from various \\ninequalities. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, \\nin 2015, there were over 300,000 reported incidents, a 44% \\nincrease from 2011 crimes against women. They are the \\nfoundation of any economy essentially forming the eventual \\nfate of the nation. She who earlier stayed at home to attend her \\ndomestic duties is now maintaining work  and home \\nsimultaneously, participating in the process of economic \\ndevelopment on an equal footing with men. \\n So, it is the time to think about their safety and it is \\npossible through IoT (Internet of Things). The main answer for \\nthe issue can be taken so that the women ought to be allocated \\nwith a well-being device that is convenient and guarantees her \\nsecurity. Our task centers around giving a Smart contraption \\ndependent on IoT arrangements that not just serve to female \\nget away from t he basic circumstances but also additionally \\nguarantees to give equality to the women. \\nIoT is the colossal number of interconnected gadgets over \\nthe web fit for overseeing computerized undertakings adroitly \\nwith no direct human inclusion. As time is passin g, an ever -\\nincreasing number of gadgets are being interconnected and IoT \\nis turning into an indispensable piece of our lives which \\npermits us to play out the day by day undertakings quicker and \\nproficiently, and in manners , we couldn't previously. In a \\nperfect world, IoT will upgrade the future schedules with \\ncanny and solid frameworks that will make our way of life \\ncalm and furthermore adjust to the ever -developing needs. It \\nwill empower us to have totally robotized frameworks that will \\nhave its applications in making our security courses of action \\nastute, by evacuating the client obstruction with any security \\ngadget. More or less, IoT has the ability to meet all our needs \\nbefore we even acknowledge what we need and will require. \\nSecurity and interconnectedness are the genuine powers of IoT \\narrangements. Wearable security gear is another area that \\nneeds more research to have such progressive services to be \\nfitted in ordinary wear however the arrangement may exist in \\nIoT. \\nThis is made possible by our device w hich not only is \\nequipped with all the safety requirements but  also sends the \\nmessages to the pre -assigned contacts in case of a dangerous \\nsituation. The main point of this work is to build up a wearable \\ngadget for the security of women. This goal is accom plished \\nby the examination of physiological signals related to body \\nreaction parameters. The physiological signs that are \\ninvestigated are galvanic skin reaction, body heartbeat , and \\nbody vibrations. This gadget is customized to ceaselessly \\nscreen the subj ect's parameters and make a move when any \\nperilous circumstances introduce itself. The body vitals of an \\nindividual in dangerous situation changes and when these \\nvitals cross the ideal values a distress algorithm gets initiated. \\nThe location of an individu al is sent to the desired contacts to \\nget the nearest help possible autonomously. The data is sent to \\nthe cloud for the regular health monitoring of an individual. \\nTactile switches are the additional feature in the gadget which \\nmakes it more efficient. The  safety device will act as a \\nguardian to the women at all times. \\n \\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY \\n \\nThe following survey helped us in finding the right set of \\nsensors and modules for building our proposed model.  \\n \\n[1] This paper suggests a security system that can ensure \\nthe safety of women and provide the necessary security \\nmeasures.

This \\nsystem can detect the location and health condition of a person \\nthat will help to take action accordingly.  \\n \\nIII. SYSTEM OVERVIEW \\n             \\n \\n \\nFig. 1. Block Diagram of the System \\n \\nThe proposed system in the present project work is \\nportrayed in Fig. 1.1 shown above in a highly remote manner \\nwith various blocks numbered which are explained as follows: \\n \\nBlock 1 gives knowledge about Galvanic Skin Response \\nSensor. The galvanic skin response (GSR), also named \\nElectrodermal Activity (EDA) and  Skin Conductance (SC) is \\nthe measure of the unceasing variations in the electrical \\nattributes of the  skin, caused by the variation of the human \\nbody sweating. \\n \\nBlock 2 gives the knowledge about Vibration Sensor (SW-\\n420 module). Vibration Sensors are sensors  for calculating, \\ndisplaying, and studying linear velocity, displacement, and \\nproximity, or acceleration. Therefore,  vibration analysis is \\nused as a tool to det ermine apparatus condition as well as the \\ndistinct location and type of complications. \\n \\nBlock 3 gives information about Pulse Rate Sensor \\n(MAX30102). Pulse rate Sensor  is a well -created plug -and-\\nplay heart-rate sensor for Arduino. This Sensor determines the \\npulse rate of the person. \\n \\nBlock 4 is the GPS unit. A GPS navigation system is a GPS \\nreceiver and audio/video (AV) peripheral constructed for a \\ndistinct goal such as a car -based or hand -held device or a \\nsmartphone app. The global positioning system (GPS) is a 24-\\nsatellite navigation tool that uses various satellite signals to \\nfind a receiver\\'s spot-on earth. \\n \\nBlock 5 is the GSM unit. SIM800L module is a GSM-GPS \\ntwo in one function module. In our system we are using it to \\nsend the location of the victim al ong with the message to the \\ncontacts which are registered. \\n \\nBlock 6 is the manual switch 1. This tactile switch is \\npressed manually by the user in case of any emergency. \\n \\nBlock 7 is the manual switch 2. This tactile switch is used \\nby the user to instruct t he beneficiary that the message which \\nwas sent previously was inaccurate and they have to just \\nneglect the message  \\n \\nThe microcontroller used is NodeMCU. NodeMCU  is an \\nopen-source IoT platform. It consists of peripheral which runs \\non the  ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems and \\nhardware which is based on the ESP -12 module. The word \\n\"NodeMCU\" by default refers to the peripheral rather than the \\ndevelopment kits. \\n \\nIV. WORKING \\n \\nThe complete working of the proposed system can be \\ndivided into different modules which are as follows: \\n \\na) Database Module: - The user requires to provide \\nthe emergency contact numbers into the system which will be \\nsaved in the code. The code used will also save the messages \\nwhich should be sent in different situations. \\n \\nb) Sensor Module: - The system separately applies \\nthe distress algorithm if the sensor module develops values \\ngreater than the threshold. As soon as the algorithm is applied \\nsystem delivers the message along with the user location to the \\nsaved contacts. At th e receiver just by ticking on the location \\nlink given in the message it can display the location on the \\nGoogle map in terms of latitude and longitude. \\n \\nc) Global Positioning System (GPS) module: - It is \\nnavigation and accurate positioning tool. It records the location \\nin the form of longitude and latitude.   \\n  \\nd) GSM System Module: - Global System for Mobile \\ncommunication (GSM) SIM card is added inside the mobile \\ndevice to deliver and obtain the messages using GPRS.  \\n \\n \\n \\nInternational Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT)\\nISSN: 2278-0181http://www.ijert.org\\nIJERTV9IS050697\\n(This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.)\\nPublished by :\\nwww.ijert.org\\nVol. 9 Issue 05, May-2020\\n1087'),\n",

CONCLUSION \\n \\nWith the world moving to the  smarter lifestyle it has \\nbecome an issue of prime importance to provide a secure \\nsystem for women. The whole idea of this project is to provide \\na wearable safety device for women and at the same time can \\nhelp in the regular hea lth monitoring of an individual. The \\narrangements made to send the alert messages to the concerned \\nauthorities in case of an emergency proved to be working \\ninstantaneously with the different variations of inputs. The \\ndata of an individual is sent to the cl oud for regular health \\nupdates. All the false alerts if triggered could be canceled with \\nthe help of the tactile switch and on the contrary, an emergency \\nmessage could also be initiated in dangerous situations. The \\nInternet of things has revolutionized the  whole \\nsecurity system and this has resulted in a more compact and \\nsecure environment for the females. \\n \\nACKNOWLEDGMENT \\n \\nThe group members want to recognize the endeavors of our \\nGuide, Prof. S udhir Kadam .

These constraints include laws that\\nlimit women’s access to and ownership of productive assets (Rakodi 2014), poor access to credit\\n(Asiedu et al. 2013), and women bearing disproportionate responsibility for household work (Fer-\\nrant, Pesando, and Nowacka 2014). In this paper, I examine an additional constraint that restricts\\nwomen’s economic mobility – safety in public spaces.\\nStreet harassment, or sexual harassment faced in public spaces, is a serious problem around the\\nworld. In Delhi, where this study is based, 95 percent of women aged 16-49 report feeling unsafe in\\npublic spaces (UN Women and International Center for Research on Women 2013). Women incur\\nsigniﬁcant psychological costs from sexual harassment (Langton and Truman 2014) and actively\\ntake precautions to avoid such confrontations (Pain 1997). For example, 84 percent of women\\naged 40 years or younger in India said that they avoid an area in their city because of harassment\\n(Livingston 2015).\\nIn this paper, I document that women in Delhi choose to attend worse ranked colleges than\\nmen, both in absolute terms and conditional on their choice set. There can be several explanations\\nfor this observation. In a country where over 85 percent of marriages are arranged (Borker et al.\\n2017), it may be that women do not care about college quality if an undergraduate degree only\\nhas signaling value in the marriage market. It could also be that women prefer to attend a local,\\nlower quality institution because of family obligations. Another potential explanation could be\\nthat women do not like competitive environments, hence they choose not to attend high quality\\ncolleges with high quality peers (Niederle and Vesterlund 2007, Niederle and Vesterlund 2011,\\nBuser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek 2014). This paper posits another explanation: in a context where\\nthe majority of students live at home and travel to college every day, women choose to attend worse-\\nranked colleges in order to avoid street harassment. Unrelated to individual or family preferences\\nthat may result in optimal choices, street harassment imposes an external constraint on women’s\\nbehavior that could potentially lead to suboptimal choices.\\n2'),\n",

In fact, such misallocation of\\nstudents to colleges, where high achieving females sort to low quality colleges, may not only affect\\nwomen’s long-term outcomes but could also have important aggregate productivity effects (Hsieh\\net al. 2016).\\nThis paper measures the extent to which perceived risk of street harassment can help explain\\nwomen’s college choices in Delhi. For this, I evaluate the gender differential in trade-offs between\\ntravel safety, college quality, travel costs, and travel time in a model of college choice. The dif-\\nference in trade-offs captures the cost of street harassment for women, since men in Delhi do not\\nface such harassment. I provide what to my knowledge is the ﬁrst evidence of the effect daily ha-\\nrassment has on a durable human capital investment such as higher education. I also estimate the\\nﬁrst revealed preference estimates of street harassment in terms of travel costs and travel time, aug-\\nmenting existing (Aguilar, Gutierrez, and Soto 2016) and mostly ongoing research on harassment.\\nI face three key identiﬁcation challenges. First, I must deﬁne the de facto set of colleges that\\na student can actually choose from. Second, I need to deﬁne the set of routes a student could take\\nto each of the colleges in their choice set. Finally, I need to determine the perceived safety of each\\ntravel route, which needs to be a measure that is likely to capture the safety perceptions of college\\nstudents.\\nTo address the main identiﬁcation challenges, I assemble a unique dataset and exploit the set-\\nup of University of Delhi (DU). DU is an umbrella entity that is composed of several colleges\\nthat are spread across Delhi. Each college has its own campus, classes, staff, and placements\\nand operates essentially like an independent university. Admissions in DU are strictly based on\\nstudents’ high school exam scores. I infer students’ comprehensive choice set of colleges, using\\ndetailed information on 4,000 students from a survey that I conducted in DU.

Finally, I combine the information on travel routes with\\ncrowd-sourced safety data from two mobile applications. The ﬁrst mobile application, SafetiPin,\\nprovides perceived spatial safety data in the form of safety audits conducted at various locations\\nacross Delhi. The second mobile application, Safecity, provides analytical data on harassment rates\\nby travel mode. The route and safety data together allow me to assign a safety score to each travel\\nroute.\\nTo assess whether women face different trade-offs between travel safety and college quality,\\ntravel costs, and travel time compared to men, I use two approaches. First, I take advantage of\\nthe DU’s admissions procedure to approximate a random allocation of college choice sets. At DU,\\nstudents apply to all colleges in the University based on their high school exam scores. Each college\\nhas a “cutoff score” or the minimum score required to gain admission to a major in the college. I\\ncompare the choices of each student with other students of the same gender who live in the same\\nneighborhood, study the same major, and have the same admission year. Given the discrete cutoffs,\\na change in students’ relative exam scores also changes their choice sets, relative to their neighbors.\\nI ﬁnd that while women’s choices seem to take into account both route safety and college quality,\\nmen’s choices only depend on quality and are consistent with a model in which preferences are\\nlexicographic in college quality.\\nSecond, I use a combination of structural econometric methods to estimate the magnitude of\\nthe students’ willingness to pay for travel safety. I estimate students’ indirect utility function using\\na nested logit model and heterogeneity in these preferences using a mixed logit model. In my\\nbenchmark speciﬁcation, students’ indirect utility depends on college quality, route safety, travel\\ncosts, and travel time, and is allowed to fully vary by gender. The analysis uses spatial variation in\\nstudents’ location, destination colleges, route choices, mode choice and area safety. Identiﬁcation\\nis based on the assumption that the difference between men and women’s unobserved preferences\\nfor a route to a college is uncorrelated with observed college quality, perceived travel safety, travel\\ncosts, and travel time.\\n4'),\n",

DU\\nis composed of 77 colleges of which 58 offer general undergraduate majors in Humanities, Com-\\nmerce and Science. 1 There are over 180,000 undergraduate students at DU (University of Delhi\\nAnnual Report 2013-14), which represents around 8 percent of all students who passed the Class\\n12 qualifying exam in India. 2 DU is also the main public central university in Delhi that offers a\\nliberal arts education. Other public universities offering general undergraduate majors are either\\nsigniﬁcantly smaller in comparison or have limited overlap with the majors offered by DU. 3 An-\\nother option for students in Delhi are the private universities. However, these private institutions\\nnot only offer limited courses but are also considerably more expensive than DU. For example, one\\nof the biggest private universities in Delhi charges on average 9 to 18 times DU’s average annual\\ntuition.\\nColleges in DU are spread across Delhi. Figure 1 shows the spread of colleges in Delhi. Col-\\nleges vary in the size of their student population; on average, a college has about 2,800 students.\\nUndergraduate studies at DU are for three years, 4 and each college offers multiple majors. On\\n1These exclude colleges that offer professional degrees like law and medicine. Of the 58 general education under-\\ngraduate colleges, 22 colleges are women only and eight colleges are evening colleges where classes take place after 2\\npm.\\n2This represents around 6.6 percent of all students who appeared for the Class 12 qualifying exam in India.\\n3These general public universities in Delhi are Jamia Millia Islamia University, Jawahar Lal Nehru University,\\nand Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. Jamia Milia has less than 14 percent of DU’s annual undergraduate\\nintake of which up to 50 percent is reserved for Muslim students. Jawahar Lal Nehru University offers undergraduate\\nprograms only in foreign languages. Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University only offers one course that is offered\\nby DU’s general undergraduate colleges.\\n4In 2013, DU attempted to move to a four-year undergraduate program (FYUP).

This\\nexam on average accounts for 75 percent of the students’ ﬁnal grades. The remaining 25 percent of\\nthe ﬁnal grade is based on internal college evaluation of the student.\\nA distinguishing feature of DU is that admission to colleges is strictly based on students’ high\\nschool exam scores. Each college speciﬁes a cutoff score or the minimum percentage required\\nto gain admission to a major. Every student who scores above this cutoff score is guaranteed\\nadmission to the college. In line with previous studies (Black and Smith 2004), I use selectivity\\nin admissions as an indicator of college quality, measured by a colleges’ cutoff score. Based on\\nthese cutoff scores I am able to rank each college in absolute terms and within a student’s choice\\nset, where a higher rank indicates a lower cutoff score and hence worse quality. The absolute rank\\nrates colleges within a major and admission year using the ﬁrst cutoff list. Rank within a student’s\\nchoice set ranks the colleges to which the student was admitted by their cutoff score for the students’\\nmajor and admission year. Figures 2a and 2b show the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of\\nthe absolute rank of a college and the CDF of rank within a student’s choice set, respectively.\\nWe can see that women’s CDF lies below the CDF for men, indicating that women choose worse\\nranked colleges than men across the distribution.

This is despite women scoring\\nhigher than men on exams at the end of high school, as shown in Figure 3.7\\nAnother feature of DU is that majority of the students (72 percent) live with their parents and\\nwith widespread protests and was embroiled in controversy since its implementation.

Next, I present a simple stylized model of college choice to characterize\\nhow women may face trade-offs between travel safety and college quality.\\n3 Stylized Model of College Choice\\nIn this section I show a simple stylized model of college choice. This model explicitly captures how\\nwomen might have to choose worse quality colleges in order to avoid travel by unsafe routes. In the\\n2×2 matrix in Figure 4a, the high-scoring students are in the ﬁrst row (high school exam score =H)\\nand low-scoring students are in the second row (high school exam score =L). In the columns, there\\nis a low quality “Not-so-good college” (Quality = n) and a high quality “Good college” (Quality\\n= g) with g > n. In between these two colleges there is a “danger” area that is unsafe, a travel\\nroute becomes unsafe if it passes through this unsafe area. There is an equal number of high and\\nlow-scoring males and females located in each college’s neighborhood. A high scoring student is\\neligible to attend both the good and the not-so-good colleges given that their high school exam\\nscore is above the cutoff for both colleges (H > g > n). A low-scoring student, on the other hand,\\nis only eligible to attend the not-so-good college given that their high school exam score is below\\nthe cutoff for the good college (g > L > n). In this model, I assume that women have two options\\nwhen choosing their travel routes: they can either avoid unsafe areas or travel by a safer but more\\nexpensive mode of transport and women prefer the former.\\nFigure 4b and 4c show the choices made by high-scoring and low-scoring males respectively.\\n9'),\n",

Figure 4d shows the\\nchoices of women who do not face a safety-quality trade-off. The high-scoring female chooses\\nthe good college and the low scoring female chooses the not-so-good college. In Figure 4e, we\\ncan see the choice of a high scoring female who would have to take an unsafe route i.e. cross the\\nunsafe area if she were to choose the good college. By assumption she avoids the unsafe area and\\nchooses the lower quality not-so-good college. Finally, Figure 4f shows the decision of the low\\nscoring woman who would have to cross the unsafe area to attend the only college she is eligible\\nfor. She chooses a safe but more expensive route to travel to the Not so good college, denoted by\\nthe dashed green arrow. In such a case this woman could have also chosen to not attend college\\nat all, denoted by the thick arrow. Given that this study examines choices of students currently\\nenrolled in DU, I am unable to evaluate the effects of safety on the decision to attend college.\\nHowever, if selection into college is similar to the selection into high and low quality colleges,\\nthen my estimates provide a lower bound of the effects of travel safety because there might be a\\nhost of women who choose to not attend college at all in order to avoid harassment.

This is a\\nsingle form that is used for admission to all colleges in the university. A student has to specify the\\nmajor(s) they wish to apply for.

The cutoffs vary by social category,12 subjects studied in Class 12 and in some\\ncases by gender of the student.13 Following the release of the cutoff list, students have about three\\ndays to register in a college of their choice. Students are required to submit their original degree\\ncertiﬁcate and pay the ﬁrst year’s annual fees at the time of admission.

Most colleges require students to include at least one language in\\nthis average.\\n10The Senior School Certiﬁcate Examinations are evaluated in a double blind manner.\\n11The majority of schools in India come under the purview of the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE),\\na board of education that conducts the Senior School Certiﬁcate Examination. The only other national board is the\\nIndian Certiﬁcate of Secondary Education. Other boards of education are at the state level. In our sample over 96\\npercent of students’ board of examination was the CBSE.\\n12Social categories refers to the ofﬁcially designated groups of historically disadvantaged people in India. These\\ncategories are used for the purposes of afﬁrmative action. These are General category (Gen), Scheduled Castes (SC),\\nScheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Castes (OBC). Another category used for admissions is Physically Hand-\\nicapped (PH). Gen is the unreserved category, SC were formerly referred to as “untouchables”, ST are the indigenous\\npeople, and OBC is the collective term used by the Government to classify castes which are socially and educationally\\ndisadvantaged but not SC.\\n13In minority colleges, cutoffs are lower for students belonging to the minority religion. A few colleges also take\\ninto account the subjects studied in Class 10, mostly for language courses. A sample cutoff list is shown in Figure A1.\\nIn this cutoff list, the cutoff score are listed by college major (rows) and students’ social categories (columns).

For every student in the sample, I compute\\nan aggregate score following guidelines speciﬁed by each college in DU. If the student’s aggregate\\nscore percentage is greater than the cutoff speciﬁed by a college, then that college is in the student’s\\nchoice set. I repeat this procedure for all cutoff lists released by every college, which is equivalent\\nto using the lowest cutoff score. 16 On average, a student has 22 colleges in their choice set. As\\nexpected, the number of colleges in a student’s choice set is positively correlated with their high\\nschool exam score and the cutoff score of their chosen college, as shown in Figure A2.\\nAccurate choice sets are crucial for my analysis. Most importantly, there should not be any\\nsystematic errors in choice sets by gender. Since the choice sets are created based on students’\\nreported high school exam scores, I test if there is any systematic misreporting of exam scores by\\ngender.

I map students’ reported travel routes as a sequence of landmarks and travel modes, taking\\ninto account the departure times. The travel information collected as part of the full survey and its\\nmapping in Google Maps ﬁlls a major data gap in India, since there are no detailed travel surveys in\\nthe country. The existing data on daily travel from the Census of India is aggregated at the district\\nlevel making it impossible to study travel choices by individual attributes. 18 To create students’\\npotential routes to the chosen college and the colleges in their choice set, up to four routes are\\nextracted per Google Maps based travel option, i.e., driving only, walking only and public transit,\\ngiving a total of up to 12 travel routes for every student to each college in their choice set. The\\npublic transit routes are then broken into separate legs based on travel modes. I drop students who\\nare outliers in terms of travel time and I also drop potential routes that have a travel time greater than\\nthe 99th percentile of reported travel time. Allowing for variation in departure times, the reported\\ntravel route is one of the options suggested by Google Maps between the origin and destination\\nfor over 90 percent of the students in sample. 19 Ultimately, for every student I have their reported\\ntravel route and potential travel routes to the college they chose and the potential travel routes they\\ncould have taken to each college in their choice set.20\\nAn example of route mapping is given in Figure A3. Figure A3a shows a student and the college\\none college, without any conﬂicts.\\n18One exception to this is the travel survey conducted by Bansal et al. (2016) in three major cities in India. However,\\nthe focus of their travel survey is vehicle ownership with a few questions on average travel patterns, as opposed to\\ndetails of daily travel routes by mode, which I collected.\\n19These checks were conducted on a 15 percent random sample of the data, stratiﬁed by travel mode.\\n20 To my knowledge, Google Maps does not factor in travel safety in their route suggestion algorithm.

These safety audits allow the user to characterize the safety\\nof a location based on nine parameters. The nine parameters are openness of spaces, visibility or\\n“eyes on the street”, presence of security personnel, the condition of the walking path, presence of\\npeople speciﬁcally women and children on the street, access to public transport, extent of lighting,\\nand the overall feeling of safety. The contributors can rate a location by assigning a score from\\n0 (low safety) to 3 (high safety) on each of the nine parameters. Details of each parameter and\\na description of the audit rubric are given in Table A1. For my benchmark speciﬁcation, I use a\\ncomposite area safety index of the nine parameters computed using principal component analysis.\\nI check for robustness by excluding one safety parameter from the safety index each time.\\nSafetiPin was launched in November 2013 in Delhi, and the app is now available in 28 cities\\nacross 10 countries. The SafetiPin data is partially crowd-sourced and partially collected by trained\\nauditors. The latter enables SafetiPin to have a wider and more representative coverage of the city\\n(Vishwanath and Basu 2015).\\nI have data on over 26,500 audits from November 2013 to January 2016, as shown in Figure 7a.\\nIn this sample, 98 percent of the contributors are 39 years or younger and 70 percent of the users\\n16'),\n",

Table 2 provides information on mode usage by gender in the full survey data and\\nproportion of harassment reports by mode from Safecity’s analytical data. Students use a variety\\nof modes to travel to college, with 38 percent of students traveling by a public or private bus for\\nsome portion of their daily route. Men are more likely to travel by bus than women. The metro\\nis the most popular mode of transport for all college students and is more popular among women\\nby a signiﬁcant margin. Of the women who travel by the metro, 86 percent reported exclusively\\ntraveling in the ladies-only compartment. A large proportion of both men and women are likely\\nto walk some part of their travel route, with men being more likely than women to have a walking\\npart. From the last column of Table 2, we can see that, in line with anecdotal evidence, buses are the\\nmost unsafe mode of transport with about 40 percent of the harassment incidents involving a bus\\nor the people in it. This is followed by the metro which covers about 16 percent of the incidents.\\n4.6 Calculating Route Safety\\nI assign a safety score to the reported and potential routes by computing a weighted average of the\\narea safety data, where the weights are the proportion of a route and harassment by travel mode (m)\\nin each safety pixel ( p).

Since I do not have full control over students choice sets, I exploit DU’s admissions\\nprocess to approximate the ideal experimental design. I use the fact that students’ high school exam\\nscores combined with colleges’ cutoff scores completely determine each student’s choice set.\\nI compare students’ choices in terms of travel safety, college quality, travel time and costs,\\nwith those of a “similar” student as their relative exam scores change. Given the discrete cutoffs, a\\nchange in the student’s relative exam score also changes their relative choice set.

The score\\nbins are of a two-point absolute score difference. In the student-neighbor pair, the index student is\\nthe student who has a greater high school exam score. In these ﬁgures, a greater score difference\\nimplies that the index student faces a bigger choice set in terms of both colleges and travel routes.\\nI ﬁnd that women choose higher quality colleges that lie on safer travel routes that are longer and\\nmarginally more expensive with an expansion in their choice set. Men also choose higher quality\\ncolleges and routes that are marginally more expensive but they do not respond in terms of safety\\nor time. From Figure 9a, we can see that there is a positive relation between safety difference and\\nthe score difference for females while there is a no such systematic relation for males. This means\\nthat while females choose safer routes relative to their neighbors as their college choice set and\\nhence their route choice set expands, this is not the case for males whose choice of relative route\\nsafety is almost ﬂat across the score differences. From Figure 9b, the positive relation between\\nquality difference and the score difference for both males and females signiﬁes that an increase\\nin the index student’s score relative to their neighbor’s is associated with an increase in relative\\ncollege quality for both men and women.

The weight students place on college quality and\\nroute safety may vary idiosyncratically and with observable student characteristics such as socio-\\neconomic status and high school academic achievement. The weight male and female students\\nplace on college quality may vary for two reasons. First, some students may simply place an in-\\nherently high value on institutional quality. Second, even if all students place low importance on\\ncollege quality, some students may face high decision making costs leading them to place lower ex-\\npressed weight on quality when determining their expected utility and selecting a college (Hastings,\\nKane and Staiger 2009). Similarly, the weight students place on route safety may vary because ei-\\nther students are inherently averse to harassment or because they face external pressure for example\\nfrom parents, to travel by safe routes. These different sources of heterogeneity cannot be separately\\nidentiﬁed in this analysis because they result in observationally equivalent choice behavior.\\nBy introducing individual heterogeneity in logit coefﬁcients, the mixed logit model allows for\\nﬂexible substitution patterns albeit by imposing more structure on the distribution of preferences.\\n25'),\n",

First, in addition to the lack of on-campus housing at DU, it is the norm that students live at\\nhome with their parents. That parents are unlikely to base their residential choices on the location of\\ntheir children’s future preferred colleges, helps to identify values placed on travel times and travel\\nsafety separately from residential sorting by focusing on the sample Delhi residents. Residential\\nsorting could overstate the importance of travel time and safety for students located near to their\\npreferred colleges.\\nSecond, the colleges in DU are spread out across the city and are located in neighborhoods with\\nvarying characteristics and with students of both genders and all socio-economic groups. Each\\nstudent faces a host of college and route choices only determined by the student’s high school\\nexam score and the colleges’ cutoff score. Figure 11 shows the characteristics of students and the\\narea around each college. Each bar represents a college and the colleges are in ascending order of\\nquality.25 Figure 11a and Figure 11b show that students with all levels of high school scores and\\nboth genders live near colleges across quality levels. There is also no sorting of colleges by quality\\naccording to the socio-economic status or safety of neighborhoods, as can be seen from Figure 11c\\nand 12d. Hence, I have wide variation in both college and student locations, providing variation in\\nroute safety for students of both genders and colleges of all quality.\\nThird, college cutoff scores do not seem to take into account women’s safety concerns. If travel\\nsafety affects the pool of students who enroll in a college, such that the number of high achieving\\nfemale students who enroll is less than what a college anticipated, it maybe that the cutoff scores\\nfor women decrease or the advantage given to them increases the following year. This could bias\\nthe safety estimate.

As shown in table A7, the overlap in choice sets\\nvaries between 76 percent to as high as 96 percent.\\n9.2 Policy Experiments\\nThere can be several policy responses to reduce street harassment or to alleviate its effects on\\nwomen’s economic choices. Using the structural estimates, I can evaluate the effects of some poli-\\ncies that are currently used and those that could be implemented. The ﬁrst best policy intervention\\nwould make public spaces safe and accessible for women such that they would face no harassment.\\nI assess the effect of such a ﬁrst best policy where all travel routes for women have the highest\\nlevel of safety observed in the data. Increasing safety of all travel routes for women improves the\\nexpected rank of their predicted college choice and women travel by cheaper but longer routes.\\nSpeciﬁcally, it reduces the average rank gap between men and women by ﬁve percent. Women’s\\ncost of travel decreases by almost 19.8 percent and their travel time increases by four percent. As\\nwe saw previously, men travel by longer and cheaper routes than women, the cost reduction from\\nan increase in travel safety closes the travel cost gap between men and women by over 28 percent.\\nAn alternative policy lever could empower women to ﬁght back, thereby inﬂuencing women’s\\npreferences for safety. This can be done in many ways, either through self-defense training, such\\nas initiatives taken by SheFighter in Egypt, or by encouraging women to reclaim public spaces\\nas in the WalkAlone campaign by Blank Noise in India, or through information campaigns like\\n’Stop Telling Women to Smile’ in several cities across the world. I estimate this in the model by\\nassuming that women and men have the same preferences for safety. While the ﬁrst best policy\\nchanges the environmental safety factor, this policy changes the preferences for different levels\\nof environmental safety. I ﬁnd that the effect of such policies is similar to the ﬁrst-best policy.\\nThe gap between men and women’s college rank reduces by four percent, and the travel cost gap\\ndecreases by 21 percent. Another intervention could be to subsidize the modes of transport for\\nsome women.36 To simulate the effect of this policy experiment, I assume that women pay the\\n36The reason I consider subsidizing travel for some but not all women is to disregard the general equilibrium effects\\n34'),\n",

While easier to implement, this intervention has half the effect of a policy that empowers\\nwomen to be less affected by the lack of safety.\\n10 Conclusion\\nStreet harassment is a serious problem around the world especially in rapidly urbanizing develop-\\ning countries. While there is qualitative evidence on the negative effects of street harassment on\\nwomen’s economic mobility, this is the ﬁrst study to quantitatively assess the long term economic\\nconsequences of street harassment. By combining unique data that I collected from the University\\nof Delhi, with route mapping from Google Maps, and mobile app safety data, I study the trade-\\noffs women face between college quality and travel safety, relative to men. I ﬁnd that women face\\nsigniﬁcant trade-offs and are willing to attend a college that is 25 percentage points lower in the\\nquality distribution for a route that is perceived to be one SD safer. Men are only willing to attend a\\ncollege that is 5 percentage points lower in the quality distribution for a route that is one SD safer.\\nAdditionally, I ﬁnd that women are willing to spend an additional Rs. 18,800 on annual travel,\\nrelative to men, for a route that is one SD safer. This amount is more than double the average an-\\nnual fees at DU. Using estimates from Sekhri (2014), on the labor-market earnings advantage from\\nattending a public college, I estimate that women’s willingness to pay for safety translates to a 20\\npercent decline in the present discounted value of their post-college salaries. These results show\\nthat street harassment is an important mechanism that could perpetuate gender inequality in both\\neducation and lifetime earnings.\\nUsing structural econometric methods, I evaluate and interpret the impact of different existing\\nand potential interventions that can alleviate the impact of street harassment on economic choices\\nof women. I ﬁnd that the ﬁrst-best policy of making all travel routes safe for women reduces\\nthe average rank gap between men and women by ﬁve percent. While it is the ultimate hope,\\nof the policy change.\\n35'),\n",

The\\ndesired outcome is most likely to be achieved through a series of multi-dimensional interventions\\nover the long-term. I ﬁnd that affecting women’s preferences for safety through empowerment,\\nhas the same effect on women’s quality of higher education as the ﬁrst-best policy, and it is more\\neffective than subsidizing travel by safer modes for them. This shows that one of the most effective\\nand sustainable class of policies would empower women to deal with harassment and hold the\\nperpetrators accountable, with support from the wider society. These multipronged policies can\\nbe in the form of self-defense training or information campaigns that make women aware of their\\nrights and also involve the community.\\nWhile this study focuses on the role of street harassment in explaining women’s choice of col-\\nlege, the ﬁndings are relevant for other economic decisions made by women that could be affected\\nby their propensity to avoid harassment. For instance, the global labor force participation rate for\\nwomen is 26.7 percentage points lower than the rate for men in 2017 and the largest gender gap in\\nparticipation rates is faced by women in emerging countries (World Employment Social Outlook\\n2017). The results of this paper suggest that street harassment could help explain part of this gender\\ngap. In the context of India, labor force participation rates for women aged 25-54 have stagnated at\\nabout 26 to 28 percent in urban areas, between 1987 and 2011. The fact that this is the case, despite\\nthe economic and demographic conditions that ordinarily would lead to rising female labor-force\\nparticipation rates, remains a long-standing puzzle (Klasen and Pieters 2015). This is an important\\nissue for India’s economic development. With a high share of working-age population, labor force\\nparticipation, savings, and investment can boost per capita growth rates. However, if a majority of\\nwomen do not participate, say because of the fear of harassment, then the effect will be never be as\\nstrong.\\n36'),\n",

This paper \\npresents an improved mobile application that prioritizes \\nwomen’s safet y through a SIM card -based location \\ntracking approach instead of relying on GPS services that \\nrequire an internet connection. This feature ensures \\nconsistent and reliable location tracking even in areas \\nwith weak or no internet access. Inspired by existing \\nplatforms like bSafe and My Safetipin, the app includes \\nan emergency alert system that allows users to trigger \\nSOS signals to authorities and nearby registered users by \\npressing the power button, volume button, or using \\nspecific gestures. The i nvolvement of nearby users aims \\nto provide immediate assistance before law enforcement \\narrives, potentially preventing harm or saving lives. The \\npaper features a survey and technical analysis detailing \\nthe app’s architecture, usability, and the benefits of SIM-\\nbased tracking for improved response times \\nduring emergencies. \\n \\n \\nKey Words:  Women’s safety, SIM card location tracking, \\nemergency alert system, SOS message, offline tracking, \\nmobile safety app, user assistance network. \\n \\n \\n1.INTRODUCTION  \\n \\nEnsuring women’s safety is a critical global issue, with \\nincidents occurring daily that highlight the need for \\neffective personal security measures. The proliferation of \\nsmartphones and advancements in mobile technology \\nhave paved the way for innovative sa fety-focused \\napplications. However, many existing apps rely heavily on \\nGPS-based internet tracking, which can be unreliable or \\nunavailable in certain locations. This limitation can delay \\nemergency responses and reduce the efficacy of safety \\nprotocols, putting users at risk. \\n \\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a \\ncomprehensive mobile app that places user safety at the \\nforefront by using SIM card -based location tracking. \\nUnlike conventional apps that require continuous internet \\naccess for GPS services, our solution le verages cellular \\nnetworks for location tracking. This ensures consistent \\nmonitoring even in areas with limited or no internet \\nconnectivity. A standout feature of the app is its discreet \\nand accessible SOS alert capability, which can be \\ntriggered by pressin g the power or volume buttons or \\nusing pre-set gestures. These alerts are sent via SMS to \\nlaw enforcement and nearby registered users, creating a \\nnetwork of responders who can assist the user before the \\narrival of police. \\n \\nThe development of this app draws inspiration from \\nplatforms like bSafe and My Safetipin but incorporates \\nenhancements that address their limitations. The main \\ninnovation is the integration of SIM -based location \\ntracking and offline alert features, which together enhance \\nreliability and responsiveness during emergencies. This \\npaper explores the app’s design, architecture, testing \\nphases, and practical applications, alongside a survey of \\nuser feedback and challenges in implementation. \\n \\nThis research contributes to the field of mobile safety \\napplications by demonstrating that SIM-based technology \\ncan serve as a robust alternative for location tracking in \\nsafety solutions. The findings aim to inform future \\ndevelopments and encourage wider adoption of offline -\\ncapable safety mechanisms. \\n \\n2. OBJECTIVE \\n \\nThe objectives of the project ‘SafeSteps’ Its intent is to come \\nup with a better and user-friendly mobile app that is focused on \\nwomen’s safety. This work seeks to assist with the growing \\nglobal concern for the online violence directed toward women \\nwherein most safety applications are limited to GPS internet \\ntracking. Such older application are not viable in places where \\nthere is little or no Internet coverage and this hinders timely \\nresponses and puts users in jeopardy. This application \\nminimizes the relia nce on the internet by utilizing a SIM card \\nbased location tracking system, hence enabling tracking and \\ncommunication in remote or network poor areas. The method \\nemploys cellular approximations to locations to avoid GPS -\\nenabled locating. This function can prove useful in rural, low \\nsatellite areas giving assurance to women that they can always \\nget network help when required regardless of coverage area. \\n \\nThe main feature of this application is the SOS notification \\nsystem, which is very discreet and easy to distinguish. Users \\ncan activate this emergency function by pressing the power \\nbutton or volume button. or make a specific gesture This makes \\nit possible to send urgent notifications in the event of a crisis. \\nThese alerts can also be sent via SMS. This instant alert system \\naims to promote a faster response. Because messages reach \\nlocal responders and law enforcement simultaneously, the \\nparticipation of nea rby registered users creates a community \\nsupport network. This may bring help to the user before the \\nauthorities arrive. This idea has inspired existing apps like \\nbSafe and My Safetipin, but also tailored enhancements to \\naddress the limitations of those platforms.'),\n",

In conflict and postconflict settings, the incidence of\\nviolence against women and girls (VAWG) is exacerbated, resulting in increased negative social, economic, health, and psy-\\nchosocial effects.

Nevertheless, while\\nsome lessons can be learned from in-house monitoring and\\nevaluation, more robust evaluations of WGSS are still needed\\nto elucidate outcomes that benefit women and girls.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, \\nin 2015, there were over 300,000 reported incidents, a 44% \\nincrease from 2011 crimes against women. They are the \\nfoundation of any economy essentially forming the eventual \\nfate of the nation.

In this paper, I examine an additional constraint that restricts\\nwomen’s economic mobility – safety in public spaces.\\nStreet harassment, or sexual harassment faced in public spaces, is a serious problem around the\\nworld. In Delhi, where this study is based, 95 percent of women aged 16-49 report feeling unsafe in\\npublic spaces (UN Women and International Center for Research on Women 2013).

There can be several explanations\\nfor this observation. In a country where over 85 percent of marriages are arranged (Borker et al.\\n2017), it may be that women do not care about college quality if an undergraduate degree only\\nhas signaling value in the marriage market.

Violence against women happens all over \\nthe world, particularly in developing countries. This violence can take many forms: physical, sexual, or psycholog- ical. [6] \\nPhysical assault on women involves the use of force to  injure or endanger them. Forms of sexual assault include rape , human \\ntrafficking and forced sexual exploitation, genital mutilation,  child marriage and intimate partner violence. Psy- chologica l abuse \\nresults in psychological trauma, which could manifest as  chronic depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress dis order. The above \\nall have severe consequences on a woman’s physical and m ental well-being. \\n \\nB.

The whole idea of this project is to provide \\na wearable safety device for women and at the same time can \\nhelp in the regular hea lth monitoring of an individual. The \\narrangements made to send the alert messages to the concerned \\nauthorities in case of an emergency proved to be working \\ninstantaneously with the different variations of inputs. The \\ndata of an individual is sent to the cl oud for regular health \\nupdates. All the false alerts if triggered could be canceled with \\nthe help of the tactile switch and on the contrary, an emergency \\nmessage could also be initiated in dangerous situations. The \\nInternet of things has revolutionized the  whole \\nsecurity system and this has resulted in a more compact and \\nsecure environment for the females. \\n \\nACKNOWLEDGMENT \\n \\nThe group members want to recognize the endeavors of our'),\n",

In this paper, I examine an additional constraint that restricts\\nwomen’s economic mobility – safety in public spaces.\\nStreet harassment, or sexual harassment faced in public spaces, is a serious problem around the\\nworld. In Delhi, where this study is based, 95 percent of women aged 16-49 report feeling unsafe in\\npublic spaces (UN Women and International Center for Research on Women 2013).

There can be several explanations\\nfor this observation.
